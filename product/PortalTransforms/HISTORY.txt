=========================

  * Allowed the abbr, acronym, var, dfn, samp, address, bdo, thead, tfoot,
    col, and colgroup tags by default, since they are harmless, valid XHTML
    and shouldn't be filtered. Fixes:
    http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6712 and
    http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7251

  * Add XSS fixes from Anton Stonor to safe_html transform.
  [alecm, stonor] (backport from 1.5.3-final)

  * casting to int is evil without previous check of the type. so we assume as
    in CMFPlone just zero for non-int-castable values.
    [jensens] (backport from 1.5.0-a1)

  * the values in the safe_html valid tag dictionary can become strings when
    modifying them via the ZMI. Explicitly convert them to integers before
    testing their value.

  * let the user configure 'initial_header_level' (cf
    'rest-header-level' directive).

  * remove id parameter from log method's arguments.

  * use self.aq_parent instead of getToolByName(self,

    with the same functionality. Migration is handled on reinstall.
    http://trac.plone.org/plone/ticket/4538
    [csenger] [dreamcatcher]

  * Removed CoUnInitialize call. According to Mark Hammond: The
    right thing to do is call that function, although almost noone
    does (including pywin32 itself, which does CoInitialize the main
    thread) and I've never heard of problem caused by this
    omission.
    [sidnei]

  * Fix a long outstanding issue with improper COM thread model
    initialization. Initialize COM for multi-threading, ignoring any
    errors when someone else has already initialized differently.

   inside the mapping.
   [dreamcatcher]

1.3.2-1 - 2004-09-04

   [dreamcatcher]
