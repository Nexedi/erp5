      Delivery/PackingList is the main document

      PackingList have 2 different states:

      - solved: this happens when quantities and target
        quantities are the same

      - diverged: this happens when quantities and target
        quantities are different

      Resolution of diverged PackingList is achieved by workflow
      methods. Such workflow methods eventually change
      movements in the simulation. Typical solution include:

      - reduce quantity

      - split delivery

      - postpone delivery
