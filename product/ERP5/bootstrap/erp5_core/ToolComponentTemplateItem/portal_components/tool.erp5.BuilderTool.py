  Builders can be local or global.

  It is safe to have only one instance of builder working at same time.

  Parameters common for methods:

    input_movement_list - optional list of movements to deliver. Corresponding
      script name is simulation_select_method_id (to rename to
      input_movement_select_method_id), defaults to type based method named
      BuilderPortalType_selectDefaultMovement

    business_process_list - optional Business Process list, if defined only
      builders for Business Links contained in those Business Process will
      be run

    trade_phase_list - optional list of trade phases, if defined only
      Business Links for this trade phase will be used

    existing_delivery_list - list of deliveries to which builder will *try*
      add new/update existing movements and update delivery. It is not
      guaranteed - if builder configuration (deliver movement groups) are
      not selecting those deliveries they won't be updated, new ones will
      be created. Corresponding script is delivery_select_method_id.
