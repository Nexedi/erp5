  The RulesTool implements portal object
  transformation policies.

  An object transformation template is defined by
  a domain and a transformation pattent:

  The domain is defined as:

  - the meta_type it applies to

  - the portal_type it applies to

  - the conditions of application (category membership, value range,
    security, function, etc.)

  The transformation template is defined as:

  - a tree of portal_types starting on the object itself

  - default values for each node of the tree, incl. the root itself

  When a transformation is triggered, it will check the existence of
  each node and eventually update values

  Transformations are very similar to XSLT in the XML world.

  Examples of applications:

  - generate accounting movements from a stock movement

  - generate a birthday event from a person

  ERP5 main application : generate submovements from movements
  according to templates. Allows to parametrize modules
  such as payroll.
