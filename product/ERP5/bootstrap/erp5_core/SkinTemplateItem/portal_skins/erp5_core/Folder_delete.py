"""Script to remove Documents inside a Folder.

The new UI does not make any exceptions and treat this script as a generic Dialog Form Method.
Thus it receives form_id of previous form, dialog_id of current dialog and uids of objects from
previous Listbox.

The distinction between XHTML resp. RSJS interface is that in the later, this script receives
`uids` directly whether in XHTML it is given `selection_name` and must extract the uids from
the selection.

:param form_id: {str} Form ID of the previous View's FormBox
:param dialog_id: {str} current dialog's Form ID
:param uids: {list[int]} list of "selected" uids from the previous View (only in JS UI)
:param selection_name: {str} if present then user is using XHTML UI
