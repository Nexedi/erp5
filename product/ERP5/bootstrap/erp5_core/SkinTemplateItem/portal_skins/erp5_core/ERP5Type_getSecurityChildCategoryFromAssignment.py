"""
This script returns a list of dictionaries which represent
the security groups which a person is member of. It extracts
the categories from the current user assignment.
It is useful in the following cases:

- associate a document (ex. an accounting transaction)
  to the division which the user was assigned to
  at the time it was created

- calculate security membership of a user

The parameters are

  base_category_list -- list of category values we need to retrieve
  user_name          -- string obtained from getSecurityManager().getUser().getId()
  object             -- object which we want to assign roles to
  portal_type        -- portal type of object

NOTE: for now, this script requires proxy manager
