/*\n
FIFO inventory valuation is about finding out the price of items in\n
inventory that stay until t=END after transactions from t=0.\n
For we care only about items found in inventory at t=END, it\n
is interesting to notice that a few of the earliest movements can be\n
discarded along the way of our computation:\n
\n
1)Assume that you know the @total_output_quantity during the considered\n
  timeframe.\n
2)Now notice that in this model you can fold all outgoing movements into a single\n
  big movement of @total_output_quantity taking place a t=END, and obtain the\n
  same, yet simpler to compute valuation.\n
3)It is then easy to see that while the sum of quantities of incoming\n
  movements accounts for less than @total_output_quantity, items queued in by\n
  these movements will be completely removed by the final outgoing movement.\n
  It is safe to ignore those first movements in our computation.\n
\n
This means that when iterating forward over incoming movements, from t=0 to t=END,\n
incoming movements can be ignored until their cumulative quantity sum is larger\n
than the total output quantity. After this, each incoming movement will stay\n
forever in inventory.\n
\n
Thus, each movement has a value of:\n
  max(0, (quantity-@unbalanced_output) * unit_price)\n
if @unbalanced_output is initialized to @total_output_quantity and reduced by\n
quantity at each step:\n
  unbalanced_output=max(0, unbalanced_output-quantity)\n

/*\n
What matters for FILO inventory value is the amount that never goes out of inventory\n
and stays in at the bottom of the pile until t=END:\n
If, for each incoming movement, we are able to tell how many items of this movement\n
are taken out of inventory in future, then we are finished: the remaining quantity\n
of this movement will be found in the final inventory and should be counted in the\n
valuation.\n
\n
To know the future/destiny of each incoming movement, the easier way is to\n
iterate movements in a backwards fashion, from latest (t=END) to earliest (t=0),\n
and remember how many items are removed from the inventory by outgoing movements.\n
\n
We sum in @unbalanced_output the (absolute) sum of outgoing movements quantities\n
until we reach an incoming movement. Then:\n
 - if incoming_movement.quantity > @unbalanced_output, we know for sure that\n
   (quantity-@unbalanced_output) WILL remain in the inventory at t=END. We can thus\n
   add (quantity-@unbalanced_output)*unit_price to asset_price, and reset\n
   @unbalanced_output to zero.\n
 - if incoming_movement.quantity <= @unbalanced_output then all of the current\n
   movement got out of inventory between t=current and T=END. These items are not\n
   present in the final inventory and can be discarded.\n
