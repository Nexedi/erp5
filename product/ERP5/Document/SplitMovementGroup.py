  This movement group is used to split all the movements that are aggregated

  XXX-Tatuya: However this test() method returns True, so the aggregated
  movements can be inserted into existing Delivery/Line/Cell that are aggregated
  by the Delivery Select Method. What use case this is applied for?

    new Delivery/Line/Cell instead of updating existing one,
