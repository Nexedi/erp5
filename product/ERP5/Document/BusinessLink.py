    The BusinessLink class embeds all information related to
    lead times and parties involved at a given phase of a business
    process. BusinessLink are also the most common way to trigger
    the build deliveries from buildable movements.

    The idea is to invoke isBuildable() on the collected simulation
    movements (which are orphan) during build "after select" process

    Here is the typical code of an alarm in charge of the building process::

      builder = portal_deliveries.a_delivery_builder
      for business_link in builder.getDeliveryBuilderRelatedValueList():
        builder.build(causality_uid=business_link.getUid(),) # Select movements

    WRONG - too slow

      Pros: global select is possible by not providing a causality_uid
      Cons: global select retrieves long lists of orphan movements which
            are not yet buildable the build process could be rather
            slow or require activities

    TODO:
    - IArrowBase implementation has too many comments which need to be
      fixed
    - _getExplanationRelatedMovementValueList may be superfluous. Make
      sure it is really needed
