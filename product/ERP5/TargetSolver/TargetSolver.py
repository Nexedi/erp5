  """
    Target solver is used to do backtracking of solved movement up to
    simulation tree.  It is able to detect if parent movement is frozen on
    not, and take proper decision - invoke itself or compensate.

    Target solver is able to generate new simulation tree for:

     * split delivery
     * simple backtrack
     * loss generation
     * etc

    AppliedRules are considered to be linear. As a first approximation,
    TargetSolver will be independent of Applied Rules.

    Possible future solutions:

    - call solve on AppliedRule to allow overriding by
      AppliedRule

    - call 'updateNewTarget' on Applied rule
      to update parent target

    This class is the base class for all target solvers.
    It's virtual due to "solve", which needs to be overloaded.
