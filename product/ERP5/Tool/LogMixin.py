    The idea of this mixin is to try to share all the code related
    to log file access, caching, log filtering and filtering
    optimisation.

    The model chosen here is simplistic:
    - one tool per service
    - account parameter is used to select the customer account
    - log_name parameter is used to select the log

    I prefer this way for now so that the code for log access in
    Tools is reduced to the minimum and we do not need to
    add so many portal types.
