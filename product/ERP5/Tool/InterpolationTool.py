    The InterpolationTool centralises interpolation
    policies to calculate values from the mapped values.

    Currently, the interpolation is simple and closed. All mapped
    values are selected and put in memory. Then, some algo is applied
    to determine a value.

    Examples of applications:

    - calculate the price of resource X for customer Y under
      condition Z

    ERP5 main application : implement attribute lookup and interpolation
    policy. Configuration done for now through mappedvalues. Later,
    this could be done another way.
