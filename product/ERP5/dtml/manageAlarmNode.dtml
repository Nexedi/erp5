<p class="form-help">
  This tab defines the node wich starts Alarms.
  To provide high performance, alarms should start a script wich only start
  some activities. Like this, the activity tool will be in charge to distribute
  the work on many nodes.
</p>

<p class="form-help">
  The interval of distribution and activation of the activities is per default 5 seconds. This can be
  changed by altering the value of <i>interval</i> in the section <i>time-server</i> in the
  Zope Configuration File <i>zope.conf</i>.
</p>

<p class="form-help">
    The <i>Alarm node</i> is responsible for the start of Alarms. The default value is empty
    which means that every existing node will try to do launch of alarms, which is fine when there
    is only one ZServer running.
    To change the Alarm Node, edit the value and click &quot;Change&quot;.
