Things should be removed from here and added to the bug tracker.



Bugs
----

 - Bo M. Maryniuck:

   "I can't reproduce the error anymore though I can't send you traceback,
    but I just found, that Localizer crashes Medusa threads if someone else
    object uses "register before traverse". In my case there is an product,
    which is always modifies the request. So if I put there also Localizer,
    you'll never enter the site.


Quality Assurance
-----------------

 - Audit the code, update the idioms (e.g. use "get_context" to access the
   request and response objects).


API
---

 - When importing modules from Localizer, either the sort or the long
   way should always be used. Update the documentation to reflect it
   (Rainer Thaden).

   Where the sort form is:

     from Products.Localizer import LocalPropertyManager

   and the long form is:

     from Products.Localizer.LocalPropertyManager import LocalPropertyManager

   See if this can be addressed without compromising backwards compatibility,
   if not document exactly which is the current situation.

 - Develop an API to get messages and translations from the message catalog,
   see email from Pierre-Yves Delens.

 - Implement the whole mapping interface in the "AcceptLanguage" and
   "AcceptCharset" classes (itools.i18n.accept). Sugested by Bjorn.


Documentation
-------------

 - Update (rewrite) the documentation. Most likely to be in latex, and
   distributed with the source.

 - Add a section "Localizer application anatomy" to the tutorial:

    "One thing you may want to consider is an overview of how a site
     using all the products should be laid out. The examples and guide
     you are providing are very very good and explain all the techcinal
     components of the variouse packages quite well. What seems to be
     missing is a higher level view that ties it all together in terms
     of layout for a demo site.

     An example of a 2-3 language basic site that uses the variouse
     components  would be very attractive for new programs and users
     (moi) and help the adoption of this most excellent product."

 - Comment about "management_page_charset" to switch the ZMI to utf-8,
   or maybe patch Zope so they're in utf-8 by default.


Localizer.org
-------------

 - Kill "http://www.j-david.net/software/localizer", everything should be
   in "http://www.ikaaro.org/localizer".


User Interface (ZMI)
--------------------

 - Complete the help screens.

 - Be sure the framed messages appear in all the management screens every
   time an action is performed, i.e. "Content changed (2002-02-08 15:26)".

 - Add PrincipiaSearchSource


Standards Support
-----------------

 - Support fuzzy in "itools.handlers.PO".

 - Use the library libgettextpo introduced in gettext 0.12 to parse the
   PO files?? See the docs: "Writing your own programs that process PO
   files"


Message Extraction
------------------

 - Kill "zgettext", use "igettext" from "itools.i18n" instead.

 - Add support for ZPT to "igettext". This means to implement part of
   the "i18n" namespace in "itools.xml.ZPT". See [1] for a sample code.

Not yet classified
------------------

 - (Zope bug) See if something feasible can be done to remove the hardcoded
   use of Latin-1 encoding from Zope and Localizer.

   If not, explain which the problems are and what the developer can
   do (add this as a task for the documentation).


 - When importing a message catalog, should be done something with
   the header? When managing the message catalog through FTP, should
   the header also be editable?

 - François Meehan:

   "Also found that using the import/export function in Localizer/zope
    can bring corruption to the po file, a problem with the accents it
    seems."

 - Document the path where Localizer.changeLanguage sets the cookie,
   which is the path from where it is called, not its physical path.
   See the mails exchanged with Claus Rosenberger. Maybe a FAQ?


 - Work on locale information: dates, money, etc..

 - Integrate the File System Message Catalog from CMFLocalizer.

 - Add the ability to manage localized versions of standard files
   in a product: the on-line help system, README.txt, etc..

 - Let to implement ZClasses that inherite from 'MessageCatalog'

 - Set the 'Vary' header.

   The problem is: which value should it have?

   This could allow to remove the patch to Zope for images, if UA
   take care of the 'Vary' header.

 - Rework 'changeLanguageForm' to support browsers without javascript.

 - Build user management interfaces similar to the ZMI
   (standard_html_header/footer instead of manage_page_header/footer
   and manage_tabs).
