# PATCH 1: Global Request
#
# The original purpose was to get the request object from places where the
# acquisition was disabled (within the __of__ method for example). It was
# inspired by the Tim McLaughlin's GlobalGetRequest proposal, see
# http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Proposals/GlobalGetRequest
#
# Currently it keeps a Context instance, which wraps the request object,
# but also other things, like the user's session, as it is required by
# the ikaaro CMS.
#
# The request objects are stored in a dictionary in the Publish module,
# whose keys are the thread id.
#
# Also, we keep the get_request method in the Globals module for backwards
# compatibility (with TranslationService for example).
