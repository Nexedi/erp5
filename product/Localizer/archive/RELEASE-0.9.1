Localizer 0.9.1
===============

Localizer is a Zope [1] product that provides a set of facilities
to develop multilingual web applications. It offers solutions to
internationalize the user interfaces and to manage multilingual
content.


Localizer becomes beta
----------------------

Finally I've decided to officially declare Localizer as beta. This
means that no new features will be added for the 1.0 release, the
focus will be stability and documentation.


What's new
----------

Added unicode support to ZPT. Final version by Florent Guillaume.

New icons for all the meta types. Now Localizer has a logo (see logo.gif).
This is a contribution of Maite Rementeria, from Code&Syntax [2].

Spanish translation updated. New japanese version!, by Kazuya Fukamachi.

Some minor bugs fixed.
