Localizer 0.9.3
===============

Localizer is a Zope product that provides a set of facilities
to develop multilingual web applications. It offers solutions to
internationalize the user interfaces and to manage multilingual
content.

This is a bug fix release, the changes are:

 - Open MO files as binary files, this caused problems on Windows.
   Thanks to Johan Carlsson

 - Correctly copy and paste Localizer instances.

 - Correctly detect Netscape 4.x, before Internet Explorer was thought
   to be NS, this caused problems with the language negotiation. Thanks
   to Olivier Nibart.

 - Add the languages from a Localizer instance (if it exists) to the
   languages input box of the LocalFolder add screen (as it already
   was done with LocalContent).

 - Quote messages in the Message Catalog interface, thanks to Geir Bækholt.
