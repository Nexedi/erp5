ERP5Subversion

  ERP5Subversion provides a Subversion interface. This product
  depends on "pysvn":http://pysvn.tigris.org/.

  To use this product, you must make a directory named 'svn' under
  your instance home, and check out repositories under the directory.
  Note that you must make sure that Zope can write to the directory and
  sub-directories.
