r"""This module provides an interface for transactional variables.

Transactional variables are data slots which can store arbitrary values
during a transaction. Transactional variables are guaranteed to vanish
when a transaction finishes or aborts, and specific to a single thread and
a single transaction. They are never shared by different threads.

Transactional variables are different from user-defined data in a REQUEST
object, in the sense that one request may execute multiple transactions, but
not vice versa. If data should persist beyond a transaction, but must not
persist over a single request, you should use a REQUEST object instead of
transactional variables.

Also, transactional variables are different from volatile attributes,
because transactional variables may not disappear within a transaction.

The constraint is that each key must be hashable, so that it can be used
as a key to a dictionary.

Example::

  from Products.ERP5Type.TransactionalVariable import getTransactionalVariable
  tv = getTransactionalVariable()
  try:
    toto = tv['toto']
  except KeyError:
    toto = tv['toto'] = getToto()
