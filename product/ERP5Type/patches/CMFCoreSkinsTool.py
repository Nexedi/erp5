    Update skin cache.

    Goal
      We must update the cache in a CPU-efficient way.
    Problem
      We cannot synchronize caches from multiple threads.
      We must avoid generating the cache multiple times in the same
      transaction, so it must be updated whenever possible.
    Solution
      We mark the skin tool object as modified and we update the cache of
      current thread.
      This way, all threads will get a cache invalidation, but still current
      thread won't suffer from systematic complete cache recreation each time
      it must be updated.
      Also, if the transaction gets aborted the cache should be flushed, but only
      for the current thread. XXX: This is an unchecked assertion.
