  This patch modifies the way CMF Portal Skins gets a skin by its name from
  the right skin folder. This way, the access complexity is O(1), and not O(n)
  (n was the number of skin folders in skin selection list) any more.

  XXX: the resolve/ignore dicts used in
  CMFCoreSkinnableSkinnableObjectManager___getattr__
  implies that it's not possible to get skins from multiple skin selections
  during the same request.

# SkinDataCleanup deletion (due to garbage collection), it sometimes deletes a
# new SKINDATA entry, unrelated to the intended one. This leaves a system with
# no SKINDATA entry for current thread, leading to errors.
# A case where it's easy to trigger such error is CMFActivity's REQUEST
# separation mechanism, where one request is created for each single activity.
