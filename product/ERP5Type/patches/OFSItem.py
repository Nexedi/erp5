Very simple volatile-attribute-based caching.

Especially useful to cache processed pseudo-constants in PythonScripts: cached
value will be set as a volatile on the PythonScript, so it gets flushed when
script is edited.
For such use, it would be even better to be able to put evaluate-once code
in PythonScripts (ie, make python scripts really become Python *Scripts*, not
"python-function-body-and-parameters").

NOTE: This patches OFS.Item.SimpleItem as it's the lowest patchable class
before persistence.Persistent, where this patch would actually belong.

  Cache "func()" return value using a volatile on self.
  Return that value, calling func only if needed.

  Usual volatile rules apply:
  - outlives transaction duration
  - bound to a thread only while a transaction is executed (ie, it can be
    reused by a different thread on next processed transaction)
  - destroyed when object is modified by another transaction
  - destroyed when object is modified by transaction and transaction gets
    aborted
  - destroyed when connection cache is minimized and holder (self) is pruned
    (minimization can be triggered in many places...)

  Of course, you should only cache values which *only* depends on self's
  pertistent properties, and no other object (persistent or not). Otherwise
  your cache will not be flushed when it needs to.
