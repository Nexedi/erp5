          * Leo Paul and you must have a beautiful web page on Nexedi ERP5 explaining the "drone a aile fixe" API
this document must list the functions, explain why they are needed
this document must list the parameters type and return type. And explain why such type has been decided
for now, we mostly followed the work previsouly done by Leo Paul I suppose
but before working with us, he was discussing a lot with Thomas and JP to decide what should be the API, type of coordinate, etc
so, I would like first to have a first version of this document explaining the current status, so that we could add Thomas in the loop after to decide what should be changed
maybe Leo Paul already has something like this, no idea
so, better wait for him to know where to start
