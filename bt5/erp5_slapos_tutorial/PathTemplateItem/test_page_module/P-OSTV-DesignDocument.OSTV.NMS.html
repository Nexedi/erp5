<h2>Goal&nbsp;and scope</h2>

<p>The goal of this document is to introduce the architecture of OSTV NMS so that an engineer can understand its purpose, the different &nbsp;components and the reference&nbsp;documents that explain its installation and operation. OSTV NMS is designed to operate 4G/5G networks based on Amarisoft stack. It derives from SlapOS [<a href="https://slapos.nexedi.com" title="SlapOS">RD</a>], a general purpose framework designed as an overlay for POSIX systems that automates the management of any times of services (VRAN, CDN, etc.) on a distributed infrastructure. This document is not a manual.</p>

<h1>Executive Summary</h1>

<p>The purpose of a Network Management System (NMS) is to automate all aspects of the management of a telecommunication network, from the initial deployment of base stations with eNodeB VRAN software till&nbsp;the management of user subscriptions. A&nbsp;Network Management System (NMS) should thus automate&nbsp;deployment of telecommunication software,&nbsp;&nbsp;provisioning of telecommunication services, provisioning of user accounts, monitoring of telecommunication services, accounting, billing, etc. A&nbsp;Network Management System should be able to detect and - ideally - predict that a&nbsp;telecommunication service is failing or that a user is complaining of service quality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Network Management System (NMS) is a fairly large and complex application software.</p>

<p>It is the central tool for a telecommunication operator to automate&nbsp;the enforcement&nbsp;of common service level&nbsp;policies&nbsp;to all services of the telecommunication network. It is the central tool to manage the quality of service provided to users by knowing what happens, where and when before even being told by users.</p>

<h2>OSTV NMS</h2>

<p>The pictures bellow demonstrate&nbsp;OSTV NMS in action.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Base Station Geographic Heat Map" src="https://slapos.nexedi.com/P-OSTV-NMS.Front.Page.ScreenShot?format=" /></p>

<p>The main screen displays a geographical map which shows&nbsp;in green base stations that are running fine, in red those that are down and in orange those that might become down. It differentiates two cases: the base station hardware ("Computer") and the base station services ("Partitions", ex. Amarisoft enb) running on the base station hardware. Whenever a base station is down, the left side of the rectangle become red. Whenever a service running on the base station encounters an exception, the right side of the rectangle becomes red. In both cases, a ticket is generated to notify administrators of the network of the existence of an issue that they should solve.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="List of Base Stations running eNodeB service" src="https://slapos.nexedi.com/P-OSTV-NMS-eNodeB.List?format=" /></p>

<p>The main screen can also be displayed as a list of servers, each of them running various services (emb, CDN, etc) that can be filtered or sorted. Each base stations provides display of its monitoring health using the same color conventions as the heat map and&nbsp;direct access to monitoring tool.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="VRAN Service Monitoring" src="https://slapos.nexedi.com/P-OSTV-NMS.Monitor.Chart.List?format=" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="List of Running Process for a VRAN service" src="https://slapos.nexedi.com/P-OSTV-NMS.Monitor.Process.List?format=" /></p>

<p>In order to fix an issue, administrators of the network can access logs on the base station through a graphical user interface. This interface displays the usage of resources (memory, CPU, etc.) as well as the state&nbsp;of so-called &quot;promises&quot; that are configured to enforce the network service quality policy. A simple promise defines for example that &quot;LTE network should be available&quot;. A more complex promise should be that &quot;LTE network should provide at least 5 Mbps to each SIM card more than 95% of the time&quot;.&nbsp;The notion of &quot;promise&quot; is essential to manage service quality and must be configured or adapted for each telecommunication company.</p>

<p>By configuring promises step by step in response to the resolution of incidents managed by issue tracking tickets, a telecommunication company can fulfill the goal of providing the level of service that its users are expecting and to be informed of incidents before anyone tells them.</p>

<h2>NMS = CCMS</h2>

<p>The purpose of a Network Management System (NMS) is&nbsp;very similar to the purpose of Cloud Computing&nbsp;Management&nbsp;System (CCMS). The equivalence table bellow compares the two:</p>

<p>This table demonstrates how it is possible to rely on an existing CCMS to build an NMS by replacing typical cloud computing&nbsp;software (qemu, mariadb, apache) with telecommunication software (Amarisoft), and by replacing the notion of server&nbsp;with the notion of&nbsp;base station. This equivalence makes completely sense for the deployment of VRAN on standard PC, as it is the case with Amarisoft stack. It can also make sense with traditional telecommunication hardware as long as a proxy service that can run on a standard PC provides access and remote control of&nbsp;traditional telecommunication equipment.</p>

<p>Moreover, relying on standard PC is also the best approach to deploy the kind of&nbsp;Edge Computing architecture that is increasingly adopted by telecommunication industry. It is becoming more and more frequent to deploy next to each eNodeB various types of network acceleration services: HTTPS CDN, IoT buffering gateway, media conversion service, etc. The reality of a modern telecommunication networks and decentralized cloud computing such as Edge Computing actually requires a solution that can unify both Network Management and Cloud Computing Management.</p>

<p>This is the approach we have chosen with OSTV NMS.</p>

<h2>SlapOS</h2>

<p>OSTV NMS is based on an existing Open Source / Free Software framework: SlapOS. Although the name &quot;SlapOS&quot; sounds like an operating system, it is not an operating system in the same meaning as Linux, Windows, BSD, etc. are operating systems.&nbsp;SlapOS is a general purpose overlay for distributed infrastructures based on&nbsp;POSIX operating system for&nbsp;(Linux, xBSD, etc.) with a strong focus on service management.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In other words, SlapOS provides the kind of&nbsp;service management features that are missing in Unix (but that used to exist in old mainframe operating systems or in Plan9). Those service management features can be leveraged to create a Network Management System that meets all requirements.</p>

<p>SlapOS has been deployed successfully since 2009 in many companies (Airbus, SANEF, Mitsubishi, etc.) and&nbsp;to operate two public clouds: VIFIB and Teralab.&nbsp;VIFIB is one of&nbsp;the inventors of Edge Computing [<a href="https://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/349884/vifib_wants_host_cloud_computing_home/" title="ViFiB wants you to host cloud computing at home">RD</a>].&nbsp;Teralab has been awarded a &quot;Silver Label&quot; [<a href="https://www.teralab-datascience.fr/fr/home/The+project/About+us/niveau-europeen-" title="TeraLab reconnue au niveau européen">RD</a>]&nbsp;by Europe&#39;s Big Data Value Association (BDVA). It is interesting to notice that Teralab has chosen SlapOS over other solutions (OpenStack, Proxmox, etc.) because it provided at much lower cost more management features, more control on hardware, more resiliency while&nbsp;consuming less resources.</p>

<p>Those characteristics (management, cost, resiliency, control of hardware, low footprint) are even more important in the case of telecommunication networks.</p>

<h1>SlapOS Architecture for VRAN</h1>

<p>SlapOS architecture is very simple. It is based on only two software components that can be installed on any GNU/Linux operating system: SlapOS Master and SlapOS Node.&nbsp;SlapOS Master is used to register each base station and define their target configuration.&nbsp;SlapOS Node is installed on each base station and ensures that its configuration matches the one defined in SlapOS Master. All other network management features derive from this simple architecture.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>SlapOS Master: Registry</h2>

<p>SlapOS Master acts as a registry of the network management system. It keeps track of the:</p>

<ul>
	<li>list of base stations with metadata (geographical location, customer, project, network, etc.);</li>
	<li>list of software&nbsp;and versions installed on each base station;</li>
	<li>list of services running on each base station with&nbsp;configuration parameters;</li>
	<li>list of issues open for each service or base station;</li>
	<li>list of invoices for each&nbsp;customer;</li>
	<li>list of users of SlapOS Master itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>In a traditional NMS setup, SlapOS Master users are the&nbsp;system administrators of the network, with very simple access control rules.</p>

<p>In a less traditional setup, SlapOS Master is used both by both system administrators and customers of the network. Access control rules are defined to limit access of users to services that they requested.</p>

<h2>SlapOS Node: Base Station Conductor</h2>

<p>SlapOS Node acts as the autonomous&nbsp;conductor of the base station which orchestrates the different services running inside&nbsp;the base station based on a&nbsp;target configuration defined in SlapOS Master.</p>

<p>SlapOS Node will&nbsp;thus make sure that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>software and versions installed on the base station are the same as those defined on SlapOS Master for the base station;</li>
	<li>services running in&nbsp;the base station&nbsp;and their configuration parameters are the same as those defined on SlapOS Master for the base station.</li>
</ul>

<p>SlapOS Node will also inform SlapOS Master of:</p>

<ul>
	<li>connection parameters required to connect to&nbsp;services running on the base station;</li>
	<li>health or status of running services.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Everything is a service</h2>

<p>The key motto of SlapOS is that &quot;<strong>everything is a service</strong>&quot;. Everything in SlapOS is thus achieved by defining and instantiating services. In the case of Network Management System (NMS), essential services are based on the Amarisoft LTE stack and&nbsp;implement Virtual Radio Access Network (VRAN). But other services may also be required: SIM card management service, HTTPS&nbsp;acceleration service, etc.</p>

<p>Here are a few&nbsp;examples of services that are usually deployed on a SlapOS Node to implement a complete VRAN architecture:</p>

<ul>
	<li>LTE which includes nme and ims;</li>
	<li>standalone LTE nme;</li>
	<li>standalone LTE ims,</li>
	<li>SIM database;</li>
	<li>HTTPS CDN.</li>
</ul>

<p>Services in SlapOS are defined using the buildout [<a href="http://www.buildout.org" title="Buildout">RD</a>] build&nbsp;language and the Jinja2 [<a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/">RD</a>] templating language. By using buildout and Jinja2, services in SlapOS are defined in a way that is <strong>independent of any GNU/Linux distribution</strong>. It is thus possible to deploy SlapOS Node services on virtually any version of Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, Red Hat, SuSE, Arch, Yocto, Gentoo, etc. without any change to the service definition in buildout. It&nbsp;does not matter if the GNU/Linux distribution is based on initd or systemd. It also does not matter whether the distribution is based on RPM, DEB, portage or pacman&nbsp;packages.</p>

<p>Services in SlapOS consists in reality of two different aspects:</p>

<ul>
	<li>a buildout file,&nbsp;also called <strong>Software Release</strong>, which defines how to build the software required to run a service;</li>
	<li>a service record in SlapOS Master registry, also known as <strong>Software Instance</strong>, which defines all parameters needed to run an instance of a service.</li>
</ul>

<p>An example of Software Release of Amarisoft LTE stack can be found here:&nbsp;https://lab.nexedi.com/nexedi/amarisoft/blob/master/slapos/software/lte/software.cfg [<a href="https://lab.nexedi.com/nexedi/amarisoft/blob/master/slapos/software/lte/software.cfg" title="Amarisoft Software Release">RD</a>].</p>

<p>An example of Software Release for an HTTPS accelerator can be found here:&nbsp;https://lab.nexedi.com/nexedi/slapos/blob/master/software/apache-frontend/software.cfg [<a href="https://lab.nexedi.com/nexedi/slapos/blob/master/software/apache-frontend/software.cfg" title="CDN Me">RD</a>].</p>

<p>If we compare the two aspects of a service to an object programming&nbsp;language,&nbsp;Software Release plays the role of a class and&nbsp;Software Instance plays the role of an object instance. Just like with object languages a single class of service (Software Release) can be used to create multiple service instances (Software Instance). A single base station can&nbsp;thus run multiple nme service instances with different parameters. It is even possible to run&nbsp;multiple nme service instances of multiple versions of the Amarisoft NME software on the same base station.</p>

<p>A base station can thus be shared between different projects, different customers or different networks with different service goals. Yet, it is&nbsp;managed in a simple and consistent way by SlapOS Master registry which keeps a&nbsp;shared state of the network.</p>

<h2>SLAP: Polling&nbsp;from Node to Master</h2>

<p>The Simple Language for Accounting and Provisioning (SLAP) communication protocol between SlapOS Node and SlapOS Master is a polling protocol with adaptive polling frequency. It is SlapOS Node which queries SlapOS master to collect its target state. It is SlapOS Node which notifies SlapOS Master to inform about its current state.</p>

<p>All communication is carried over HTTPS with X509 certificates allocated by SlapOS Master.&nbsp;One&nbsp;X509 certificate is allocated for each base station and for each service. Communication between SlapOS Node and SlapOS Master are thus encrypted and authenticated with a high level of detail. Also, by using HTTPS rather than a specific protocol, it is easy to deploy SlapOS Node in corporate networks which restrict most ports and protocols other than HTTP and HTTPS.</p>

<p>An interesting consequence&nbsp;of polling is that SlapOS Node can be deployed behind&nbsp;a NAT or a firewall. This means that an LTE base station could be deployed behind a standard xDSL Internet access with NAT, yet could be completely controlled remotely. It is also possible to deploy an&nbsp;LTE base station on a secure network with virtually no access from outside world, as long as it is allowed for this base station to query SlapOS Master IP address through HTTPS.</p>

<p>SlapOS polling architecture&nbsp; is thus very convenient for all kinds of applications (edge, defense, industrial, etc.) where base stations are used in a private context.</p>

<h2>Base Station Autonomous Operation</h2>

<p>SlapOS Node runs in an autonomous way. It contains all&nbsp;software and algorithms to ensure that its state converges autonomously towards the state defined in SlapOS Master. This autonomous approach goes in the opposite direction of centralized configuration systems such as Puppet,&nbsp;Chef or even Ansible that use a central server to run&nbsp;all algorithms that automate infrastructure. SlapOS Master only defines the desired target state. SlapOS Node runs algorithms that make its current state converge towards the&nbsp;desired state.</p>

<p>As a consequence, SlapOS Master / SlapOS Node architecture is much more scalable than centralized&nbsp;configuration systems. It also means that a SlapOS Node can still operate and benefit from Network Management algorithms&nbsp;whenever network access to SlapOS Master has been&nbsp;cut. It can thus provide the kind of resiliency that is expected in applications such as&nbsp;edge computing, defense, industrial IoT, etc.</p>

<h2>Zero Knowledge</h2>

<p>SlapOS Master only defines the configuration of SlapOS Nodes. It does need to not store:</p>

<ul>
	<li>passwords to access SlapOS nodes;</li>
	<li>passwords to access services running on SlapOS nodes;</li>
	<li>logs of services running to&nbsp;SlapOS nodes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to polling, SlapOS nodes do not need to run ssh or any remote control software.</p>

<p>It is thus possible with SlapOS architecture to create a &quot;Zero Knowledge&quot; system. Even by attacking&nbsp;SlapOS Master, it is impossible to retrieve information that would help an intrusion into SlapOS nodes.</p>

<h2>Log analysis</h2>

<p>Another principle of SlapOS architecture is that &quot;<strong>everything that can be decentralized should be&nbsp;decentralized</strong>&quot;.</p>

<p>Logs of services running on SlapOS Node are thus&nbsp;by default stored on the node rather than uploaded somewhere. This saves&nbsp;network bandwidth and&nbsp;improves&nbsp;scalability&nbsp;.</p>

<p>A utility called &quot;SlapOS Monitor&quot; is provided to access logs and visualize node state. Network administrators can thus get a nice real-time overview of a collection of SlapOS Nodes: memory, CPU, health, etc. just like in a centralized system. It is even possible to visualize logs offline thanks to modern HTML5 offline technology used by&nbsp;SlapOS Monitor.</p>

<h2>IPv6</h2>

<p>SlapOS Node to SlapOS Master communication is based on IPv4 or IPv6. SlapOS Node to SlapOS Node communication is based on <u>IPv6 only</u>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This choice was made so that it is possible to allocate a different IPv6 address to each service running on a SlapOS Node and to benefit from various improvements that IPv6 provides to TCP/IP networks. We also made this choice because it simplifies the orchestration of services on Edge networks, by removing all the problems posed by NAT in IPv4.&nbsp; It is also much easier and cheaper to purchase an IPv6 AS range than an IPv4 AS range nowadays in most regions of the world. Last, we observe that any major network operator (NTT, Google) have already migrated their administration network to IPv6.</p>

<p>In terms of IPv6 implementation we strongly recommend to deploy re6st [<a href="https://re6st.nexedi.com/" title="re6st">RD</a>] resilient network on each SlapOS Node and on SlapOS Master. Although this is not a requirement, it is the only way we are aware of today to implement a low latency resilient network based on babel routing protocol (a protocol that is being standardized by IETF as an improved alternative to OSPF).</p>

<p>For a simple trial or proof of concept, using a private IPv6 address range can be enough.</p>

will be required to build up the network and create software instances accessible to users.</p>

<h2>Requirements COMP-ROOT</h2>
<p>The COMP-ROOT computer must have public IPv4 or private IPv4 reachable from COMP-0 (and users). For running a network of 80-160 actual computers, it should at least have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>4-8 CPU cores (8 vCores) - preferrably i7, XEON, AMD</li>
  <li>8-16 GB RAM</li>
  <li>200GB SSD harddisk (480GB preferred)</li>
</ul>

<p>The recommended configuation for this computer is Linux Distribution are Debian 8 or Debian 9 as these are distributions tested continuously on a daily basis.</p>

<h2>Requirements COMP-0</h2>
<p>The COMP-0 computer requires a valid SSL wildcard certificate as well as IPv6. At a minimum it should have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2-4 Cores</li>
  <li>4-8 GB RAM</li>
  <li>60-100 GB SSD harddisk (mostly needed for logs)</li>
</ul>

<p>The recommended configuation for this computer is Linux Distribution are Debian 8 or Debian 9 as these are distributions tested continuously on a daily basis.</p>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>
SlapOS is self-contained. Dependencies for Debian [<a href="https://lab.nexedi.com/nexedi/slapos.package/blob/master/obs/slapos/debian/control" title="SlapOS Dependencies - Debian">RD</a>] and RPM [<a href="https://lab.nexedi.com/nexedi/slapos.package/blob/master/obs/slapos/templates/slapos.spec.in#L62" title="SlapOS Dependencies - RPM">RD</a>] can 
be found on Gitlab (SlapOS requires bridge-utils, python, gcc-c++, make, patch, wget and python-xml). When using the single line installer, 
Ansible is another dependency but only of the installer itself. In general, SlapOS installer/package/buildout handle dependencies automatically.
</p>
<p>
For a SlapOS node itself, the list of software includes can be found in the slapos buildout config file [<a href="https://lab.nexedi.com/nexedi/slapos/blob/master/component/slapos/buildout.cfg#L4" title="SlapOS Buildout.cfg - list of software">RD</a>].
