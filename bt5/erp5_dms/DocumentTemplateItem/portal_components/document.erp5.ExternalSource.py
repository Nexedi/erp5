  """
  An External Source consists of single URL which defines the
  root of a collection of documents, each of which can be accessed
  individually. The URL can be an http site, an ftp site, a local repository,
  a samba server, etc.

  The main purpose of External Sources is to group related documents
  and define shared security policies, shared updated policies, etc.
  For example, all pages of
  a wiki with restricted access rights share the same security policy
  (ex. team, project, etc.). Another purpose of the External Source class is
  to make it easy to manage external sources of knowledge (adding them,
  removing them, etc.).

  The second purpose of an external source is to provide a way to search
  contents stored externally in a system which is not compatible with
  ERP5 Catalog.

  Example of external sources:

  - a Web Site

  - a SAMBA share

  - an FTP server

  - a backup server

  - a mail directory

  - a mailing list archive

  ExternalSource may be subclassed to provide more automation
  features. This is useful for example to manage the creation
  of a mailing list, the deletion of mailing list and the
  definition of the members of a mailing list in a centralised way.

  NOTE: RSS feeds are not external sources but standard Text
  documents with transformation and update policy. They use
  the populateContent method to create subcontent from
  a root content. This is different with crawling.

  NOTE2: access to filesystems through URL requires to extend
  urllib2 so that directories are handled as if they were web
  pages OR RSS feed with a list of files (and associated URL).
  Complete implemetation of external sources will require
  major extensions to urllib2 (or equivalent).

  NOTE3: it is possible to make external search sources persistent
  by triggering an activity with newContent for every displayed
  result. This can be done by wrapping the results in a generator
  (yield). The interest of this approach is to make it possible to
  search already searched contents without having to go through the
  external source search (ie. with the front page search).
