  """The BusinessProcess class is a container class which is used
  to describe business processes in the area of trade, payroll
  and production. Processes consists of a collection of Business Link
  which define an arrow between a 'predecessor' trade_state and a
  'successor' trade_state, for a given trade_phase_list.

  Core concepts in BusinessProcess are the notions of "explanation".
  Explanation represents the subtree of a simulation tree of all
  simulation movements related to an applied rule, a delivery line,
  a delivery, etc.

  Example:
    portal_simulation/2/sm1/a1/sm2/a2/sm3
    portal_simulation/2/sm1/a1/sm2/a2/sm4

    explanation(portal_simulation/2/sm1/a1/sm2/a2) is
      portal_simulation/2/sm1/a1/sm2/a2/sm3
      portal_simulation/2/sm1/a1/sm2/a2/sm4
      portal_simulation/2/sm1/a1/sm2
      portal_simulation/2/sm1

  Business Process completion, dates, etc. are calculated
  always in the context of an explanation. Sometimes,
  it is necessary to ignore certain business link to evaluate
  completion or completion dates. This is very true for Union
  Business Processes. This is the concept of Business Link closure,
  ie. filtering out all Business Link which are not used in an explanation.

  TODO:
  - add support to prevent infinite loop. (but beware, this notion has changed
    with Union of Business Process, since the loop should be detected only
    as part of a given business process closure)
  - handle all properties of PaymentCondition in date calculation
  - review getRemainingTradePhaseList
  - optimize performance so that the completion dates are calculated
    only once in a transaction thanks to caching (which could be
    handled in coordination with ExplanationCache infinite loop
    detection)
  - fine a better way to narrow down paremeters to copy without
    using a rule parameter
  - should _getPropertyAndCategoryList remain a private method or
    become part of IMovement ?
  - add security declarations
  - why are we using objectValues in some places ?
  - add a property to rules in order to determine whether dates
    are provided by the rule or by business link / trade model path. This is an extension
    of the idea that root applied rules provide date information.
  - use explanation cache more to optimize speed
  - DateTime must be extended in ERP5 to support  +infinite and -infinite
    like floating points do
  - support conversions in trade model path
