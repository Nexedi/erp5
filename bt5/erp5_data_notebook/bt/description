Interaction between Jupyter (former IPython Notebook) and ERP5.

!WARNING!
This business template is unsafe to install on a public server as one of the extensions uses eval and allows remote code execution. Proper security should be taken into account. 
This template includes a highly experimental integration with PivotTableJs which doesn't follow ERP5 JavaScript standards and will be re factored to use jIO and RenderJS.
