      <p>
        Usability of web applications is not only determined by functionality and UI components
        but also through the way actual content is displayed. Following is a brief
        overview of things to keep in mind when presenting content.

      <h3 class="ui-content-header-inline">Usage of Fonts</h3>
      <p>
        Not resorting to the default fonts provided by the browser can already 
        make a huge difference. Free webfonts are easily integratable (for example
        Google WebFonts) and available via CDN.
      </p>
      <p>
        When working with fonts make sure to have the font in all necessary version
        available (cross-browser support) and try to limit usage to a few types (font-weight 400, 700 (bold))
        for example. This will keep download size of fonts small.

      <h3 class="ui-content-header-inline">Text Decoration</h3>
      <p>
        There are a number of CSS properties available to modify text content 
        (for example see uppercase/lowercase-ing text or letter-spacing). These
        can easily be used to differentiate elements which would otherwise maybe
        be difficult to distinguish (for example label &amp; static input fields).
      </p>
      <p>
        When doing so, it is always good to define a "theme" with certain rules
        upfront and then implement the defined text decorations throughout the application.

    <section class="ui-body-c ui-content-section ui-grid-container ui-responsive">
      <h3 class="ui-content-header-inline">Content Structuring</h3>
      <p>
        To keep text readable it should be structured to not overwhelm the user
        with long passages of text. Adding subheaders and subsections can provide
        useful information about the section following and aid the user in better
        comprehending the presented content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Subjective readability is also determined by a host of other factos, such
        as the number of characters per line, the font-size used or the line-spacing.
        While there is no defined standard on what is appropriate, numerous online resources
        point to content characteristics, which foster text readability.
