XXX: each case must be handled separatelly in this precise representation :
 - both top fields must be in the same div, so they must be identified
   strictly by their name.
 - the middle field is rendered like the two top ones, but outside of the
   top block.
 - the bottom block is rendered in another way (without its group name) so it
   must be rendered separatelly.
This leads to minor code duplication, but it's still code duplication.

Breaks strict compatibility:
  * Groups must be named one of "left", "right", "center", "bottom" otherwise they will not
      be rendered.
  * Group order doesn't matter. Case is sensitive.

It is possible to specify a group id and a group title by naming a group following the
  "group id (Group Title)" pattern. In this case the group id will be used as fieldset css
  class and as tag id. The group title will be used as a legend for the fieldset. If no group
  title is found, we use group id as title.
