  <h2 class="summary">Summary Headline: What this Leaflet is about</h2> 
  <p>
  Foo is a Web based operating system (OS) for desktop and laptop based on 
  Bar. It is designed for low maintenance cost and high interoperability. 
  Foo HTML5 technology provides independence from single Cloud Computing 
  provider, strong privacy and high interoperability with enterprise IT infrastructure.
  </p> 
  
  <h2>Straightforward User Interface</h2> 
  <p>
  Foo user interface has been acclaimed by users and media for its ease of 
  use and straightforwardness. Thanks to  the Web's pervasive nature, users feel 
  no change and thus adopt Foo in a matter of seconds.
  </p> 
    
  <h2>Zero Maintenance</h2> 
  <p>
  Applications for Foo are based on HTML5 W3C standard. They require no 
  explicit installation or upgrade, leading to zero maintenance cost. Foo 
  core can be upgraded automatically through online upgrade service. 
  </p> 
  
  <h2>Ubiquitous HTML5 Appstore</h2> 
  <div class="left-icon"> <img alt="" src="Template.Test.Image.Screenshot.Erp5?format=png" /> 
    <p class="excerpt">Foo HTML5 Appstore</p> 
  </div> 
  <p>
  Foo Appstore is a collection of HTML5 applications for text processing, 
  drawing, spreadsheet, presentation, accounting, project management, etc. 
  HTML5 applications can be used on Foo PC or on any device with a modern 
  HTML5 compatible Web browser. This includes Windows PC, Apple computers, 
  Android smartphones, etc. The ubiquitous nature of Foo applications ensures 
  interoperability in heterogenous environments.
  </p>

  <h2>Work Anywhere</h2> 
  <p>
  Foo HTML5 applications can be used online or offline, including in countries 
  where Internet connectivity is less reliable or in locations without Internet 
  access such as airplanes. Foo can operate in China where it has received 
  official ICP registration. It can also operate in highly sensitive private 
  networks with no Internet access.
  </p> 
    
  <h2>Never lose your data</h2> 
  <div class="left-icon"> <img alt="" src="Template.Test.Image.Screenshot.Erp5?format=png" /> 
    <p class="excerpt">Foo supports new generation low cost Baz such as Snip 1234</p> 
  </div> 
  <p>
  Foo storage is based on Couscous technology. Couscous provides interoperability with 
  virtually any storage technology. Public clouds: Zip, Zap and Zop. 
  Private clouds: Zup, Zyp. Browser storage.
  </p> 
  
  <p>
  Couscous can store data in enterprise database (MariaDB, MongoDB) or in business 
  applications (Tschaka, Hooray, Krupal). Replication in multiple storage 
  technologies virtually elimininate any risk of losing user data.
  </p> 
  
  <h2>Trade Secret Protection</h2> 
  <p>
  Foo's Couscous technology reduces sthe risks of theft of  valuable corporate 
  information through data encryption, data splitting and searchable encrypted 
  indexing.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Enterprise Directory Integration</h2> 
  <p>
  Foo user accounts are by default managed locally on each device with no 
  requirement of Internet access. HTML5 applications do not require prior 
  identification. Integration with Enterprise Directory is possible through OpenID.
  </p> 
  
  <h2>Interoperability</h2> 
  <p>
  Foo supports Bulgur applications through virtual desktop service deployed 
  on public or private Cloud.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Longer Battery Life</h2> 
  <p>
  Foo runs efficiently on low power hardware with typical battery operation of 10 hours.
  </p> 
  
  <h2>Wide Hardware Support</h2> 
  <p>
  Foo supports any Abc or Def (Efg, Hij, Klm, Nop, Qrs, etc.). X provides 
  customisation service to support any hardware based on 
  x86 (Intel) or ARM (Rockchip) architecture.
  </p> 
  
  <h2>Open Source</h2> 
  <p>
  Foo is open source software. Its source code is fully auditable and thus 
  exempt of secret back doors. It includes a developer mode with Linux tools 
  and a complete Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
