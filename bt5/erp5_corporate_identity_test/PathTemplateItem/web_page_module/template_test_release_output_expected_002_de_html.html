<p><strong>Here, There, Everywhere, November 4th, 1976</strong>. Hokuspokus Computing Solutions, and Foo today announced the general availibility of a turnkey Enterprise Cloud offering based on recertified Open Hardware Solutions (OHS) and Bar fully integrated Edge Cloud solution.</p>

<p>The hardware offering relies on building blocks of 180 dual Xeon servers. Each subsystem integrates 2880 x86 core, 11.5 TB of main memory and 180 TB of high performance, full SSD storage. Networking relies on redundant industry standard 10 Gbps Ethernet. Each building block is coming at a price of 205,000 Euros and is ready to scale to hundred thousands of cores.</p>

</p>

<p>The software offering relies on Bar Open Source / Free Software. Bar integrates IaaS (virtualisation, nano-containers), PaaS, software defined networking, accounting, billing, provisionning, orchestration, automated disaster recovery, network resiliency and edge computing. Typical Bar monthly operating cost per building block is 4800 euro.</p>

<p>For about 1 million euros, a corporation can create it&#39;s private Cloud backbone with up to 16 000 x86 cores and full control on costs and foreign intelligence threats, something which can not be guaranteed by public cloud providers in any country.</p>

<p>Jon Doe, CEO of Foo, explains: &quot;Bar performance on big data loads has been benchmarked as four times higher than with other cloud platforms. Total monthly operating cost of a 16 GB / 2 core virtual machine is about 7 euros, which is 2 to 10 times less than current public cloud providers.&quot;</p>

<p>Jim Donahugh, CEO of Hokuspokus Computing, concludes: &quot;Open Hardware is a fast growing trend in the IT hardware industry and opens doors to new business opportunities, that leverage the main benefit of such a design approach. Customers can benefit from a more flexible infrastructure, easier to manage solutions, virtually unlimited lifetime and better disposale solutions.&quot;</p>

<p>Proposed offers comes with a full 1 year on site warranty and require a limited space of 2.5 sqm per building block.</p>
