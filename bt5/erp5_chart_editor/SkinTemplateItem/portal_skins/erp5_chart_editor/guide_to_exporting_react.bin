Guide for exporting the react-chart-editor component

This was done on commit 9094c50 of react-chart-editor.
This version of react-chart-editor uses webpack version 3.8.1.
Operating System: Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS

Note: React-chart-editor should be downloaded and any changes made to the
      current react components source file needs to be copied into 
        
      /react-chart-editor/examples/simple/src/App.js
      
      In the case file paths used in this tutorial change, these can be 
      deduced by looking at the projects package.json, specifically the file
      listed under in the build script key. This file should import the
      required webpack.config file that needs to be changed in step 2 below.
      
      The use of a different webpack version or a different compiler may also 
      change the necessary steps required to export the component.  

Step 1)
    Install project dependencies under /react-chart-editor/examples/simple
    
        e.g. cd ~/react-chart-editor/examples/simple
             npm install

Step 2)
    Change the webpack configuration to create a library module. The webpack 
    config file is located under:

        /react-chart-editor/examples/simple/node_modules/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.prod.js
    
    In the config file at the end of output: under module.exports = add the 
    lines
        
        libraryTarget: 'umd',
        library: 'EntryPoint',   <- change this depending on the desired library name

    Once this is complete the file should look something like this:
    
        ...
        module.exports = {
            ...
            output: {
                ...
                libraryTarget: 'umd',   
                library: 'EntryPoint',  
            },
            resolve: {
                ...
                
Step 3)
    Change the source file to export the desired component, this file is 
    located under:
    
        /react-chart-editor/examples/simple/src/App.js
        
    Change the last line of App.js from
        
        export default App;
        
    to 
        
        export default {
            App: App
        };
        
Step 4)
    Delete the current index.js, and rename App.js to index.js.
    
Step 5)
    Create the production build:
        
        cd ~/react-chart-editor/examples/simple
        npm run build
        
        
Thats it, now the .js and .css files located in

    /react-chart-editor/examples/simple/build/static/js/main...js
    /react-chart-editor/examples/simple/build/static/css/main...css
    
need to be just need to be imported in the projects .html file as well as the 
React and ReactDOM libraries, see: https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html

The exported component can then be accessed by using:

    EntryPoint.default.App  <- if library name was changed in step 2) substitute this for EntryPoint
