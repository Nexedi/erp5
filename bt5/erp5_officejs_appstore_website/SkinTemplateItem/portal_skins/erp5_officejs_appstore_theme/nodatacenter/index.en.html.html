<h1 class="page_title">No Datacenter: Post-Cloud Chronicles</h1>

<p>Version: 001</p>

<p>This chronicle introduces technologies that will eventually supercede Cloud Computing.
</p>

<p>I am a software developer. Friends call me Si Yan Ge (4 eyes). I have been using Internet since 1989 and the Web since 1993. I developed my first commercial software in 1981. Now I run a small software company in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Internet as we know it today has become an essential tool for business competitiveness. Cloud Computing further cut costs by automating business sotware deployment. However, modern Internet and Cloud Computing suffers from new plagues: <a href="http://iwgcr.org/availability-ranking-of-world-cloud-computing-2012-update/">lack of resiliency</a>, <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/etudes/join/1999/168184/DG-4-JOIN_ET%281999%29168184_EN.pdf">lack of trade secret</a>, <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/cloud-computing/the-danger-the-coming-big-cloud-monopolies-114">lack of competition</a> and <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2011/04/greenpeace-report-cloud-and-internet-use-sucks-energy-emits-co2.html">high CO2 emissions</a>.</p>

<p>Both plagues originate in the same place: data centers.</p>

<p>Various projects have tried in recent years to fix data centers plagues. All projects have failed or will fail.</p>

<p>Data centers are hopelessly flawed because they create an  incentive for anti-competitive business practices that are not resilient and thus have no long term future. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/sep/29/cloud.computing.richard.stallman">Richard Stallman was right</a> in 2008, even though our motivation here is primarily economy.
</p>

<p>This chronicle will thus focus on theories, business models and technologies that can lead to the elimination of data centers, for the great benefit of long term economy. Thanks to HTML5 and  low cost mobile technologies (created in China), this goal is no longer a dream of researchers. 
</p>

<p>Most important: if you create or discover any new technology that can supercede Cloud Computing, let me know! I will publish it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1: Decentralization Theory</h2>

<p>One should understand which key aspects in successful decentralized production systems lead to their success. We could identify until now four aspects: Intelligent End Points (Internet), Zero Marginal Cost (Free / Open Source Software), Zero Knowledge (Resilient Computing) an Zero Emission (App Stores).</p>

<p><b>Intelligent End Points</b>. What makes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Internet">Internet</a> resilient is the idea of placing network intelligence at the end-points. End-points are in particular reponsible of <i>reliable delivery of data, rather than the network itself</i>.</p>

<p><b>Zero Marginal Cost</b>. What makes a small company able to compete with a bigger one without requiring a lot if capital is its ability to distribute products or services to millions of users at zero marginal cost. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">Open Source</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> in particular are typical examples of how zero marginal cost business models can defeat a large coporation in less than 10 years.</p>

<p><b>Zero Knowledge</b>. What makes a computer system able to protect trade secrets is the combination of cryptography and system architectures that keep no knowledge of how users could access it.</p>

<p><b>Zero Emission</b>. What eliminates CO2 emisions can be either to turnoff computer device or to reuse their all thermal power to heat households.</p>

<p>The table bellow compares current cloud, ideal post-cloud and two technologies that cloud superce cloud: Resilient Computing and Offline HTML5.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2: Resilient Computing</h2>

<p>Resilient Computing solves the lack of resiliency of Cloud Computing by decentralizing servers and placing them in homes or in offices. It uses the same kind of technologies as Cloud Compuuting to automate provisionning, billing, etc. Resilient Computing is compatible with most legacy applications (Linux, Windows, etc.). Its adoption does not require migration effort nor new developments.</p>

<p>Resilient Computing can also solve in theory other problems found in Cloud Computing. However, due to current lack of support in the industry (consumer electronics, telecommunication), zero marginal cost can not be reached. This currently limits its adoption to niche markets: mission critical applications, government safety, high performance computing.</p>

<p>Resilient Computing requires modern routing technology in order to circumvent connectivity incidents that frequently occur  between telecommunication companies due to human error or bugs. So-called <b>overlay</b> networks that create a virtual Internet on top of Internet provide full network resiliency and a kind of provider independent service level agreement.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3: Offline HTML5</h2>

<p><a href="http://diveintohtml5.info/offline.html">Offline HTML5</a> eliminates data centers by eliminating servers. This approach requires to redevelop all applications in a quite different way. Redevelopment effort can be costly even though migration tools exist.
</p>

<p>Offline HTML5 is compatible with Zero Marginal Cost business model. This is a huge advantage over Resilient Computing in order to accelerate adoption. Considering the growing importance of HTML5 in mobile device (phones, tablets) and the growing importance of Javascript in enteprise computing, Offline HTML5 is probably the appropriate approach for the long term whereas resilient computing satisfies short term needs and niche markets (ex. big data).</p>
