class rrule(rrulebase):
    """
    That's the base of the rrule operation. It accepts all the keywords
    defined in the RFC as its constructor parameters (except byday,
    which was renamed to byweekday) and more. The constructor prototype is::

            rrule(freq)

    Where freq must be one of YEARLY, MONTHLY, WEEKLY, DAILY, HOURLY, MINUTELY,
    or SECONDLY.

    .. note::
        Per RFC section 3.3.10, recurrence instances falling on invalid dates
        and times are ignored rather than coerced:

            Recurrence rules may generate recurrence instances with an invalid
            date (e.g., February 30) or nonexistent local time (e.g., 1:30 AM
            on a day where the local time is moved forward by an hour at 1:00
            AM).  Such recurrence instances MUST be ignored and MUST NOT be
            counted as part of the recurrence set.

        This can lead to possibly surprising behavior when, for example, the
        start date occurs at the end of the month:

        >>> from dateutil.rrule import rrule, MONTHLY
        >>> from datetime import datetime
        >>> start_date = datetime(2014, 12, 31)
        >>> list(rrule(freq=MONTHLY, count=4, dtstart=start_date))
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        [datetime.datetime(2014, 12, 31, 0, 0),
         datetime.datetime(2015, 1, 31, 0, 0),
         datetime.datetime(2015, 3, 31, 0, 0),
         datetime.datetime(2015, 5, 31, 0, 0)]

    Additionally, it supports the following keyword arguments:

    :param cache:
        If given, it must be a boolean value specifying to enable or disable
        caching of results. If you will use the same rrule instance multiple
        times, enabling caching will improve the performance considerably.
    :param dtstart:
        The recurrence start. Besides being the base for the recurrence,
        missing parameters in the final recurrence instances will also be
        extracted from this date. If not given, datetime.now() will be used
        instead.
    :param interval:
        The interval between each freq iteration. For example, when using
        YEARLY, an interval of 2 means once every two years, but with HOURLY,
        it means once every two hours. The default interval is 1.
    :param wkst:
        The week start day. Must be one of the MO, TU, WE constants, or an
        integer, specifying the first day of the week. This will affect
        recurrences based on weekly periods. The default week start is got
        from calendar.firstweekday(), and may be modified by
        calendar.setfirstweekday().
    :param count:
        How many occurrences will be generated.

        .. note::
            As of version 2.5.0, the use of the ``until`` keyword together
            with the ``count`` keyword is deprecated per RFC-5545 Sec. 3.3.10.
    :param until:
        If given, this must be a datetime instance, that will specify the
        limit of the recurrence. The last recurrence in the rule is the greatest
        datetime that is less than or equal to the value specified in the
        ``until`` parameter.

        .. note::
            As of version 2.5.0, the use of the ``until`` keyword together
            with the ``count`` keyword is deprecated per RFC-5545 Sec. 3.3.10.
    :param bysetpos:
        If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers,
        positive or negative. Each given integer will specify an occurrence
        number, corresponding to the nth occurrence of the rule inside the
        frequency period. For example, a bysetpos of -1 if combined with a
        MONTHLY frequency, and a byweekday of (MO, TU, WE, TH, FR), will
        result in the last work day of every month.
    :param bymonth:
        If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers,
        meaning the months to apply the recurrence to.
    :param bymonthday:
        If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers,
        meaning the month days to apply the recurrence to.
    :param byyearday:
        If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers,
        meaning the year days to apply the recurrence to.
    :param byweekno:
        If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers,
        meaning the week numbers to apply the recurrence to. Week numbers
        have the meaning described in ISO8601, that is, the first week of
        the year is that containing at least four days of the new year.
    :param byweekday:
        If given, it must be either an integer (0 == MO), a sequence of
        integers, one of the weekday constants (MO, TU, etc), or a sequence
        of these constants. When given, these variables will define the
        weekdays where the recurrence will be applied. It's also possible to
        use an argument n for the weekday instances, which will mean the nth
        occurrence of this weekday in the period. For example, with MONTHLY,
        or with YEARLY and BYMONTH, using FR(+1) in byweekday will specify the
        first friday of the month where the recurrence happens. Notice that in
        the RFC documentation, this is specified as BYDAY, but was renamed to
        avoid the ambiguity of that keyword.
    :param byhour:
        If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers,
        meaning the hours to apply the recurrence to.
    :param byminute:
        If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers,
        meaning the minutes to apply the recurrence to.
    :param bysecond:
        If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers,
        meaning the seconds to apply the recurrence to.
    :param byeaster:
        If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers,
        positive or negative. Each integer will define an offset from the
        Easter Sunday. Passing the offset 0 to byeaster will yield the Easter
        Sunday itself. This is an extension to the RFC specification.

    Almanac", P.  Kenneth Seidelmann, editor.

    This algorithm implements three different easter

    1 - Original calculation in Julian calendar, valid in
        dates after 326 AD
    2 - Original method, with date converted to Gregorian
        calendar, valid in years 1583 to 4099
    3 - Revised method, in Gregorian calendar, valid in
        years 1583 to 4099 as well

    * ``EASTER_JULIAN   = 1``
    * ``EASTER_ORTHODOX = 2``
    * ``EASTER_WESTERN  = 3``

    """
    The relativedelta type is based on the specification of the excellent
    work done by M.-A. Lemburg in his
    `mx.DateTime <https://www.egenix.com/products/python/mxBase/mxDateTime/>`_ extension.
    However, notice that this type does *NOT* implement the same algorithm as
    his work. Do *NOT* expect it to behave like mx.DateTime's counterpart.

    There are two different ways to build a relativedelta instance. The
    first one is passing it two date/datetime classes::

        relativedelta(datetime1, datetime2)

    The second one is passing it any number of the following keyword arguments::

        relativedelta(arg1=x,arg2=y,arg3=z...)

        year, month, day, hour, minute, second, microsecond:
            Absolute information (argument is singular); adding or subtracting a
            relativedelta with absolute information does not perform an arithmetic
            operation, but rather REPLACES the corresponding value in the
            original datetime with the value(s) in relativedelta.

        years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds, microseconds:
            Relative information, may be negative (argument is plural); adding
            or subtracting a relativedelta with relative information performs
            the corresponding aritmetic operation on the original datetime value
            with the information in the relativedelta.

        weekday:
            One of the weekday instances (MO, TU, etc). These instances may
            receive a parameter N, specifying the Nth weekday, which could
            be positive or negative (like MO(+1) or MO(-2). Not specifying
            it is the same as specifying +1. You can also use an integer,
            where 0=MO.

        leapdays:
            Will add given days to the date found, if year is a leap
            year, and the date found is post 28 of february.

        yearday, nlyearday:
            Set the yearday or the non-leap year day (jump leap days).
            These are converted to day/month/leapdays information.

    Here is the behavior of operations with relativedelta:

    1. Calculate the absolute year, using the 'year' argument, or the
       original datetime year, if the argument is not present.

    2. Add the relative 'years' argument to the absolute year.

    3. Do steps 1 and 2 for month/months.

    4. Calculate the absolute day, using the 'day' argument, or the
       original datetime day, if the argument is not present. Then,
       subtract from the day until it fits in the year and month
       found after their operations.

    5. Add the relative 'days' argument to the absolute day. Notice
       that the 'weeks' argument is multiplied by 7 and added to
       'days'.

    6. Do steps 1 and 2 for hour/hours, minute/minutes, second/seconds,
       microsecond/microseconds.

    7. If the 'weekday' argument is present, calculate the weekday,
       with the given (wday, nth) tuple. wday is the index of the
       weekday (0-6, 0=Mon), and nth is the number of weeks to add
       forward or backward, depending on its signal. Notice that if
       the calculated date is already Monday, for example, using
       (0, 1) or (0, -1) won't change the day.

    The relativedelta type is based on the specification of the excellent
    work done by M.-A. Lemburg in his
    `mx.DateTime <https://www.egenix.com/products/python/mxBase/mxDateTime/>`_ extension.
    However, notice that this type does *NOT* implement the same algorithm as
    his work. Do *NOT* expect it to behave like mx.DateTime's counterpart.

    There are two different ways to build a relativedelta instance. The
    first one is passing it two date/datetime classes::

        relativedelta(datetime1, datetime2)

    The second one is passing it any number of the following keyword arguments::

        relativedelta(arg1=x,arg2=y,arg3=z...)

        year, month, day, hour, minute, second, microsecond:
            Absolute information (argument is singular); adding or subtracting a
            relativedelta with absolute information does not perform an arithmetic
            operation, but rather REPLACES the corresponding value in the
            original datetime with the value(s) in relativedelta.

        years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds, microseconds:
            Relative information, may be negative (argument is plural); adding
            or subtracting a relativedelta with relative information performs
            the corresponding aritmetic operation on the original datetime value
            with the information in the relativedelta.

        weekday:
            One of the weekday instances (MO, TU, etc). These instances may
            receive a parameter N, specifying the Nth weekday, which could
            be positive or negative (like MO(+1) or MO(-2). Not specifying
            it is the same as specifying +1. You can also use an integer,
            where 0=MO.

        leapdays:
            Will add given days to the date found, if year is a leap
            year, and the date found is post 28 of february.

        yearday, nlyearday:
            Set the yearday or the non-leap year day (jump leap days).
            These are converted to day/month/leapdays information.

    Here is the behavior of operations with relativedelta:

    1. Calculate the absolute year, using the 'year' argument, or the
       original datetime year, if the argument is not present.

    2. Add the relative 'years' argument to the absolute year.

    3. Do steps 1 and 2 for month/months.

    4. Calculate the absolute day, using the 'day' argument, or the
       original datetime day, if the argument is not present. Then,
       subtract from the day until it fits in the year and month
       found after their operations.

    5. Add the relative 'days' argument to the absolute day. Notice
       that the 'weeks' argument is multiplied by 7 and added to
       'days'.

    6. Do steps 1 and 2 for hour/hours, minute/minutes, second/seconds,
       microsecond/microseconds.

    7. If the 'weekday' argument is present, calculate the weekday,
       with the given (wday, nth) tuple. wday is the index of the
       weekday (0-6, 0=Mon), and nth is the number of weeks to add
       forward or backward, depending on its signal. Notice that if
       the calculated date is already Monday, for example, using
       (0, 1) or (0, -1) won't change the day.

    Sets the the ``tzinfo`` parameter on naive datetimes only

    This is useful for example when you are provided a datetime that may have
    either an implicit or explicit time zone, such as when parsing a time zone
    string.

    .. doctest::

        >>> from dateutil.tz import tzoffset
        >>> from dateutil.parser import parse
        >>> from dateutil.utils import default_tzinfo
        >>> dflt_tz = tzoffset("EST", -18000)
        >>> print(default_tzinfo(parse('2014-01-01 12:30 UTC'), dflt_tz))
        2014-01-01 12:30:00+00:00
        >>> print(default_tzinfo(parse('2014-01-01 12:30'), dflt_tz))
        2014-01-01 12:30:00-05:00

    :param dt:
        The datetime on which to replace the time zone

    :param tzinfo:
        The :py:class:`datetime.tzinfo` subclass instance to assign to
        ``dt`` if (and only if) it is naive.

    :return:
        Returns an aware :py:class:`datetime.datetime`.

    This method was ported from the work done by GM Arts,
    on top of the algorithm by Claus Tondering, which was
    based in part on the algorithm of Ouding (1940), as
    quoted in "Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical
    Almanac", P.  Kenneth Seidelmann, editor.

    This algorithm implements three different easter
    calculation methods:

    1 - Original calculation in Julian calendar, valid in
        dates after 326 AD
    2 - Original method, with date converted to Gregorian
        calendar, valid in years 1583 to 4099
    3 - Revised method, in Gregorian calendar, valid in
        years 1583 to 4099 as well

    These methods are represented by the constants:

    * ``EASTER_JULIAN   = 1``
    * ``EASTER_ORTHODOX = 2``
    * ``EASTER_WESTERN  = 3``

    The default method is method 3.

    More about the algorithm may be found at:

    `GM Arts: Easter Algorithms <http://www.gmarts.org/index.php?go=415>`_

    and

    `The Calendar FAQ: Easter <https://www.tondering.dk/claus/cal/easter.php>`_

    That's the base of the rrule operation. It accepts all the keywords
    defined in the RFC as its constructor parameters (except byday,
    which was renamed to byweekday) and more. The constructor prototype is::

            rrule(freq)

    Where freq must be one of YEARLY, MONTHLY, WEEKLY, DAILY, HOURLY, MINUTELY,
    or SECONDLY.

    .. note::
        Per RFC section 3.3.10, recurrence instances falling on invalid dates
        and times are ignored rather than coerced:

            Recurrence rules may generate recurrence instances with an invalid
            date (e.g., February 30) or nonexistent local time (e.g., 1:30 AM
            on a day where the local time is moved forward by an hour at 1:00
            AM).  Such recurrence instances MUST be ignored and MUST NOT be
            counted as part of the recurrence set.

        This can lead to possibly surprising behavior when, for example, the
        start date occurs at the end of the month:

        >>> from dateutil.rrule import rrule, MONTHLY
        >>> from datetime import datetime
        >>> start_date = datetime(2014, 12, 31)
        >>> list(rrule(freq=MONTHLY, count=4, dtstart=start_date))
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        [datetime.datetime(2014, 12, 31, 0, 0),
         datetime.datetime(2015, 1, 31, 0, 0),
         datetime.datetime(2015, 3, 31, 0, 0),
         datetime.datetime(2015, 5, 31, 0, 0)]

    Additionally, it supports the following keyword arguments:

    :param cache:
        If given, it must be a boolean value specifying to enable or disable
        caching of results. If you will use the same rrule instance multiple
        times, enabling caching will improve the performance considerably.
    :param dtstart:
        The recurrence start. Besides being the base for the recurrence,
        missing parameters in the final recurrence instances will also be
        extracted from this date. If not given, datetime.now() will be used
        instead.
    :param interval:
        The interval between each freq iteration. For example, when using
        YEARLY, an interval of 2 means once every two years, but with HOURLY,
        it means once every two hours. The default interval is 1.
    :param wkst:
        The week start day. Must be one of the MO, TU, WE constants, or an
        integer, specifying the first day of the week. This will affect
        recurrences based on weekly periods. The default week start is got
        from calendar.firstweekday(), and may be modified by
        calendar.setfirstweekday().
    :param count:
        How many occurrences will be generated.

        .. note::
            As of version 2.5.0, the use of the ``until`` keyword together
            with the ``count`` keyword is deprecated per RFC-5545 Sec. 3.3.10.
    :param until:
        If given, this must be a datetime instance, that will specify the
        limit of the recurrence. The last recurrence in the rule is the greatest
        datetime that is less than or equal to the value specified in the
        ``until`` parameter.

        .. note::
            As of version 2.5.0, the use of the ``until`` keyword together
            with the ``count`` keyword is deprecated per RFC-5545 Sec. 3.3.10.
    :param bysetpos:
        If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers,
        positive or negative. Each given integer will specify an occurrence
        number, corresponding to the nth occurrence of the rule inside the
        frequency period. For example, a bysetpos of -1 if combined with a
        MONTHLY frequency, and a byweekday of (MO, TU, WE, TH, FR), will
        result in the last work day of every month.
    :param bymonth:
        If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers,
        meaning the months to apply the recurrence to.
    :param bymonthday:
        If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers,
        meaning the month days to apply the recurrence to.
    :param byyearday:
        If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers,
        meaning the year days to apply the recurrence to.
    :param byweekno:
        If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers,
        meaning the week numbers to apply the recurrence to. Week numbers
        have the meaning described in ISO8601, that is, the first week of
        the year is that containing at least four days of the new year.
    :param byweekday:
        If given, it must be either an integer (0 == MO), a sequence of
        integers, one of the weekday constants (MO, TU, etc), or a sequence
        of these constants. When given, these variables will define the
        weekdays where the recurrence will be applied. It's also possible to
        use an argument n for the weekday instances, which will mean the nth
        occurrence of this weekday in the period. For example, with MONTHLY,
        or with YEARLY and BYMONTH, using FR(+1) in byweekday will specify the
        first friday of the month where the recurrence happens. Notice that in
        the RFC documentation, this is specified as BYDAY, but was renamed to
        avoid the ambiguity of that keyword.
    :param byhour:
        If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers,
        meaning the hours to apply the recurrence to.
    :param byminute:
        If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers,
        meaning the minutes to apply the recurrence to.
    :param bysecond:
        If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers,
        meaning the seconds to apply the recurrence to.
    :param byeaster:
        If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers,
        positive or negative. Each integer will define an offset from the
        Easter Sunday. Passing the offset 0 to byeaster will yield the Easter
        Sunday itself. This is an extension to the RFC specification.

        If a `BYXXX` sequence is passed to the constructor at the same level as
        `FREQ` (e.g. `FREQ=HOURLY,BYHOUR={2,4,7},INTERVAL=3`), there are some
        specifications which cannot be reached given some starting conditions.

        This occurs whenever the interval is not coprime with the base of a
        given unit and the difference between the starting position and the
        ending position is not coprime with the greatest common denominator
        between the interval and the base. For example, with a FREQ of hourly
        starting at 17:00 and an interval of 4, the only valid values for
        BYHOUR would be {21, 1, 5, 9, 13, 17}, because 4 and 24 are not
        coprime.

        :param start:
            Specifies the starting position.
        :param byxxx:
            An iterable containing the list of allowed values.
        :param base:
            The largest allowable value for the specified frequency (e.g.
            24 hours, 60 minutes).

        This does not preserve the type of the iterable, returning a set, since
        the values should be unique and the order is irrelevant, this will
        speed up later lookups.

        In the event of an empty set, raises a :exception:`ValueError`, as this
        results in an empty rrule.

        Calculates the next value in a sequence where the `FREQ` parameter is
        specified along with a `BYXXX` parameter at the same "level"
        (e.g. `HOURLY` specified with `BYHOUR`).

        :param value:
            The old value of the component.
        :param byxxx:
            The `BYXXX` set, which should have been generated by
            `rrule._construct_byset`, or something else which checks that a
            valid rule is present.
        :param base:
            The largest allowable value for the specified frequency (e.g.
            24 hours, 60 minutes).

        If a valid value is not found after `base` iterations (the maximum
        number before the sequence would start to repeat), this raises a
        :exception:`ValueError`, as no valid values were found.

        This returns a tuple of `divmod(n*interval, base)`, where `n` is the
        smallest number of `interval` repetitions until the next specified
        value in `byxxx` is found.

    The ``tzrange`` object is a time zone specified by a set of offsets and
    abbreviations, equivalent to the way the ``TZ`` variable can be specified
    in POSIX-like systems, but using Python delta objects to specify DST
    start, end and offsets.

    :param stdabbr:
        The abbreviation for standard time (e.g. ``'EST'``).

    :param stdoffset:
        An integer or :class:`datetime.timedelta` object or equivalent
        specifying the base offset from UTC.

        If unspecified, +00:00 is used.

    :param dstabbr:
        The abbreviation for DST / "Summer" time (e.g. ``'EDT'``).

        If specified, with no other DST information, DST is assumed to occur
        and the default behavior or ``dstoffset``, ``start`` and ``end`` is
        used. If unspecified and no other DST information is specified, it
        is assumed that this zone has no DST.

        If this is unspecified and other DST information is *is* specified,
        DST occurs in the zone but the time zone abbreviation is left
        unchanged.

    :param dstoffset:
        A an integer or :class:`datetime.timedelta` object or equivalent
        specifying the UTC offset during DST. If unspecified and any other DST
        information is specified, it is assumed to be the STD offset +1 hour.

    :param start:
        A :class:`relativedelta.relativedelta` object or equivalent specifying
        the time and time of year that daylight savings time starts. To specify,
        for example, that DST starts at 2AM on the 2nd Sunday in March, pass:

            ``relativedelta(hours=2, month=3, day=1, weekday=SU(+2))``

        If unspecified and any other DST information is specified, the default
        value is 2 AM on the first Sunday in April.

    :param end:
        A :class:`relativedelta.relativedelta` object or equivalent representing
        the time and time of year that daylight savings time ends, with the
        same specification method as in ``start``. One note is that this should
        point to the first time in the *standard* zone, so if a transition
        occurs at 2AM in the DST zone and the clocks are set back 1 hour to 1AM,
        set the `hours` parameter to +1.

    inverted offset format, so normally ``GMT+3`` would be parsed as an offset
    3 hours *behind* GMT. The ``tzstr`` time zone object will parse this as an
    offset 3 hours *ahead* of GMT. If you would like to maintain the POSIX
    behavior, pass a ``True`` value to ``posix_offset``.

        Optional. If set to ``True``, interpret strings such as ``GMT+3`` or

        Provides a unified interface for assigning the ``fold`` attribute to
        datetimes both before and after the implementation of PEP-495.

        :param fold:
            The value for the ``fold`` attribute in the returned datetime. This
            should be either 0 or 1.

        :return:
            Returns an object for which ``getattr(dt, 'fold', 0)`` returns
            ``fold`` for all versions of Python. In versions prior to
            Python 3.6, this is a ``_DatetimeWithFold`` object, which is a
            subclass of :py:class:`datetime.datetime` with the ``fold``

            data.

            This is reimplemented in ``_DatetimeWithFold`` because pypy3 will

    This is an abstract base class for time zones represented by an annual
    transition into and out of DST. Child classes should implement the following
    methods:

        * ``__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)``
        * ``transitions(self, year)`` - this is expected to return a tuple of
          datetimes representing the DST on and off transitions in standard
          time.

    A fully initialized ``tzrangebase`` subclass should also provide the
    following attributes:
        * ``hasdst``: Boolean whether or not the zone uses DST.
        * ``_dst_offset`` / ``_std_offset``: :class:`datetime.timedelta` objects
          representing the respective UTC offsets.
        * ``_dst_abbr`` / ``_std_abbr``: Strings representing the timezone short
          abbreviations in DST and STD, respectively.
        * ``_hasdst``: Whether or not the zone has DST.

relative deltas), local machine timezone, fixed offset timezone, and UTC

    .. doctest::

        >>> from datetime import *
        >>> from dateutil.tz import *

        >>> datetime.now()
        datetime.datetime(2003, 9, 27, 9, 40, 1, 521290)

        >>> datetime.now(tzutc())
        datetime.datetime(2003, 9, 27, 12, 40, 12, 156379, tzinfo=tzutc())

        >>> datetime.now(tzutc()).tzname()
        'UTC'

    .. versionchanged:: 2.7.0
        ``tzutc()`` is now a singleton, so the result of ``tzutc()`` will
        always return the same object.

        .. doctest::

            >>> from dateutil.tz import tzutc, UTC
            >>> tzutc() is tzutc()
            True
            >>> tzutc() is UTC
            True

    This is a ``tzinfo`` subclass thant allows one to use the ``tzfile(5)``
    format timezone files to extract current and historical zone information.

    :param fileobj:
        This can be an opened file stream or a file name that the time zone
        information can be read from.

    :param filename:
        This is an optional parameter specifying the source of the time zone
        information in the event that ``fileobj`` is a file object. If omitted
        and ``fileobj`` is a file stream, this parameter will be set either to
        ``fileobj``'s ``name`` attribute or to ``repr(fileobj)``.

    See `Sources for Time Zone and Daylight Saving Time Data
    <https://data.iana.org/time-zones/tz-link.html>`_ for more information. Time
    zone files can be compiled from the `IANA Time Zone database files
    <https://www.iana.org/time-zones>`_ with the `zic time zone compiler
    <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=zic&sektion=8>`_

    The ``tzrange`` object is a time zone specified by a set of offsets and
    abbreviations, equivalent to the way the ``TZ`` variable can be specified
    in POSIX-like systems, but using Python delta objects to specify DST
    start, end and offsets.

    :param stdabbr:
        The abbreviation for standard time (e.g. ``'EST'``).

    :param stdoffset:
        An integer or :class:`datetime.timedelta` object or equivalent
        specifying the base offset from UTC.

        If unspecified, +00:00 is used.

    :param dstabbr:
        The abbreviation for DST / "Summer" time (e.g. ``'EDT'``).

        If specified, with no other DST information, DST is assumed to occur
        and the default behavior or ``dstoffset``, ``start`` and ``end`` is
        used. If unspecified and no other DST information is specified, it
        is assumed that this zone has no DST.

        If this is unspecified and other DST information is *is* specified,
        DST occurs in the zone but the time zone abbreviation is left
        unchanged.

    :param dstoffset:
        A an integer or :class:`datetime.timedelta` object or equivalent
        specifying the UTC offset during DST. If unspecified and any other DST
        information is specified, it is assumed to be the STD offset +1 hour.

    :param start:
        A :class:`relativedelta.relativedelta` object or equivalent specifying
        the time and time of year that daylight savings time starts. To specify,
        for example, that DST starts at 2AM on the 2nd Sunday in March, pass:

            ``relativedelta(hours=2, month=3, day=1, weekday=SU(+2))``

        If unspecified and any other DST information is specified, the default
        value is 2 AM on the first Sunday in April.

    :param end:
        A :class:`relativedelta.relativedelta` object or equivalent representing
        the time and time of year that daylight savings time ends, with the
        same specification method as in ``start``. One note is that this should
        point to the first time in the *standard* zone, so if a transition
        occurs at 2AM in the DST zone and the clocks are set back 1 hour to 1AM,
        set the `hours` parameter to +1.


    **Examples:**

    .. testsetup:: tzrange

        from dateutil.tz import tzrange, tzstr

    .. doctest:: tzrange

        >>> tzstr('EST5EDT') == tzrange("EST", -18000, "EDT")
        True

        >>> from dateutil.relativedelta import *
        >>> range1 = tzrange("EST", -18000, "EDT")
        >>> range2 = tzrange("EST", -18000, "EDT", -14400,
        ...                  relativedelta(hours=+2, month=4, day=1,
        ...                                weekday=SU(+1)),
        ...                  relativedelta(hours=+1, month=10, day=31,
        ...                                weekday=SU(-1)))
        >>> tzstr('EST5EDT') == range1 == range2
        True

    ``tzstr`` objects are time zone objects specified by a time-zone string as
    it would be passed to a ``TZ`` variable on POSIX-style systems (see
    the `GNU C Library: TZ Variable`_ for more details).

    There is one notable exception, which is that POSIX-style time zones use an
    inverted offset format, so normally ``GMT+3`` would be parsed as an offset
    3 hours *behind* GMT. The ``tzstr`` time zone object will parse this as an
    offset 3 hours *ahead* of GMT. If you would like to maintain the POSIX
    behavior, pass a ``True`` value to ``posix_offset``.

    The :class:`tzrange` object provides the same functionality, but is
    specified using :class:`relativedelta.relativedelta` objects. rather than
    strings.

    :param s:
        A time zone string in ``TZ`` variable format. This can be a
        :class:`bytes` (2.x: :class:`str`), :class:`str` (2.x: :class:`unicode`)
        or a stream emitting unicode characters (e.g. :class:`StringIO`).

    :param posix_offset:
        Optional. If set to ``True``, interpret strings such as ``GMT+3`` or
        ``UTC+3`` as being 3 hours *behind* UTC rather than ahead, per the
        POSIX standard.

    .. caution::

        Prior to version 2.7.0, this function also supported time zones
        in the format:

            * ``EST5EDT,4,0,6,7200,10,0,26,7200,3600``
            * ``EST5EDT,4,1,0,7200,10,-1,0,7200,3600``

        This format is non-standard and has been deprecated; this function
        will raise a :class:`DeprecatedTZFormatWarning` until
        support is removed in a future version.

        :param tzid:
            If there is exactly one time zone available, omitting ``tzid``
            or passing :py:const:`None` value returns it. Otherwise a valid
            key (which can be retrieved from :func:`keys`) is required.

        :raises ValueError:
            Raised if ``tzid`` is not specified but there are either more
            or fewer than 1 zone defined.

        :returns:
            Returns either a :py:class:`datetime.tzinfo` object representing
            the relevant time zone or :py:const:`None` if the ``tzid`` was

    Given a datetime that may be imaginary, return an existing datetime.

    This function assumes that an imaginary datetime represents what the
    wall time would be in a zone had the offset transition not occurred, so
    it will always fall forward by the transition's change in offset.

    ..doctest::
        >>> from dateutil import tz
        >>> from datetime import datetime
        >>> NYC = tz.gettz('America/New_York')
        >>> print(tz.resolve_imaginary(datetime(2017, 3, 12, 2, 30, tzinfo=NYC)))
        2017-03-12 03:30:00-04:00

        >>> KIR = tz.gettz('Pacific/Kiritimati')
        >>> print(tz.resolve_imaginary(datetime(1995, 1, 1, 12, 30, tzinfo=KIR)))
        1995-01-02 12:30:00+14:00

    As a note, :func:`datetime.astimezone` is guaranteed to produce a valid,
    existing datetime, so a round-trip to and from UTC is sufficient to get
    an extant datetime, however, this generally "falls back" to an earlier time
    rather than falling forward to the STD side (though no guarantees are made
    about this behavior).

    :param dt:
        A :class:`datetime.datetime` which may or may not exist.

    :return:
        Returns an existing :class:`datetime.datetime`. If ``dt`` was not
        imaginary, the datetime returned is guaranteed to be the same object
        passed to the function.

        """
        Parse an ISO-8601 datetime string into a :class:`datetime.datetime`.

        An ISO-8601 datetime string consists of a date portion, followed
        optionally by a time portion - the date and time portions are separated
        by a single character separator, which is ``T`` in the official
        standard. Incomplete date formats (such as ``YYYY-MM``) may *not* be
        combined with a time portion.

        Supported date formats are:

        Common:

        - ``YYYY``
        - ``YYYY-MM`` or ``YYYYMM``
        - ``YYYY-MM-DD`` or ``YYYYMMDD``

        Uncommon:

        - ``YYYY-Www`` or ``YYYYWww`` - ISO week (day defaults to 0)
        - ``YYYY-Www-D`` or ``YYYYWwwD`` - ISO week and day

        The ISO week and day numbering follows the same logic as
        :func:`datetime.date.isocalendar`.

        Supported time formats are:

        - ``hh``
        - ``hh:mm`` or ``hhmm``
        - ``hh:mm:ss`` or ``hhmmss``
        - ``hh:mm:ss.sss`` or ``hh:mm:ss.ssssss`` (3-6 sub-second digits)

        Midnight is a special case for `hh`, as the standard supports both
        00:00 and 24:00 as a representation.

        .. caution::

            Support for fractional components other than seconds is part of the
            ISO-8601 standard, but is not currently implemented in this parser.

        Supported time zone offset formats are:

        - `Z` (UTC)
        - `HH:MM`
        - `HHMM`
        - `HH`

        Offsets will be represented as :class:`dateutil.tz.tzoffset` objects,
        with the exception of UTC, which will be represented as
        :class:`dateutil.tz.tzutc`. Time zone offsets equivalent to UTC (such
        as `+00:00`) will also be represented as :class:`dateutil.tz.tzutc`.

        :param dt_str:
            A string or stream containing only an ISO-8601 datetime string

        :return:
            Returns a :class:`datetime.datetime` representing the string.
            Unspecified components default to their lowest value.

        .. warning::

            As of version 2.7.0, the strictness of the parser should not be
            considered a stable part of the contract. Any valid ISO-8601 string
            that parses correctly with the default settings will continue to
            parse correctly in future versions, but invalid strings that
            currently fail (e.g. ``2017-01-01T00:00+00:00:00``) are not
            guaranteed to continue failing in future versions if they encode
            a valid date.

"""
This module offers a generic date/time string parser which is able to parse
most known formats to represent a date and/or time.

This module attempts to be forgiving with regards to unlikely input formats,
returning a datetime object even for dates which are ambiguous. If an element
of a date/time stamp is omitted, the following rules are applied:

- If AM or PM is left unspecified, a 24-hour clock is assumed, however, an hour
  on a 12-hour clock (``0 <= hour <= 12``) *must* be specified if AM or PM is
  specified.
- If a time zone is omitted, a timezone-naive datetime is returned.

If any other elements are missing, they are taken from the
:class:`datetime.datetime` object passed to the parameter ``default``. If this
results in a day number exceeding the valid number of days per month, the
value falls back to the end of the month.

Additional resources about date/time string formats can be found below:

        This function breaks the time string into lexical units (tokens), which

        the character set, so any continuous string of letters is considered
        one unit, any continuous string of numbers is considered one unit.

        The main complication arises from the fact that dots ('.') can be used
        both as separators (e.g. "Sep.20.2009") or decimal points (e.g.
        "4:30:21.447"). As such, it is necessary to read the full context of
        any dot-separated strings before breaking it into tokens; as such, this

def parse(timestr, parserinfo=None, **kwargs):
    """

    Parse a string in one of the supported formats, using the
    ``parserinfo`` parameters.

    :param timestr:
        A string containing a date/time stamp.

    :param parserinfo:
        A :class:`parserinfo` object containing parameters for the parser.
        If ``None``, the default arguments to the :class:`parserinfo`
        constructor are used.

    The ``**kwargs`` parameter takes the following keyword arguments:

    :param default:
        The default datetime object, if this is a datetime object and not
        ``None``, elements specified in ``timestr`` replace elements in the
        default object.

    :param ignoretz:
        If set ``True``, time zones in parsed strings are ignored and a naive
        :class:`datetime` object is returned.

    :param tzinfos:
        Additional time zone names / aliases which may be present in the
        string. This argument maps time zone names (and optionally offsets
        from those time zones) to time zones. This parameter can be a
        dictionary with timezone aliases mapping time zone names to time
        zones or a function taking two parameters (``tzname`` and
        ``tzoffset``) and returning a time zone.

        The timezones to which the names are mapped can be an integer
        offset from UTC in seconds or a :class:`tzinfo` object.

           :options: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

            >>> from dateutil.parser import parse

            >>> tzinfos = {"BRST": -7200, "CST": gettz("America/Chicago")}

        This parameter is ignored if ``ignoretz`` is set.

    :param dayfirst:
        Whether to interpret the first value in an ambiguous 3-integer date
        (e.g. 01/05/09) as the day (``True``) or month (``False``). If
        ``yearfirst`` is set to ``True``, this distinguishes between YDM and
        YMD. If set to ``None``, this value is retrieved from the current
        :class:`parserinfo` object (which itself defaults to ``False``).

    :param yearfirst:
        Whether to interpret the first value in an ambiguous 3-integer date
        (e.g. 01/05/09) as the year. If ``True``, the first number is taken to
        be the year, otherwise the last number is taken to be the year. If
        this is set to ``None``, the value is retrieved from the current
        :class:`parserinfo` object (which itself defaults to ``False``).

    :param fuzzy:
        Whether to allow fuzzy parsing, allowing for string like "Today is
        January 1, 2047 at 8:21:00AM".

    :param fuzzy_with_tokens:
        If ``True``, ``fuzzy`` is automatically set to True, and the parser
        will return a tuple where the first element is the parsed
        :class:`datetime.datetime` datetimestamp and the second element is
        a tuple containing the portions of the string which were ignored:

            >>> from dateutil.parser import parse
            >>> parse("Today is January 1, 2047 at 8:21:00AM", fuzzy_with_tokens=True)
            (datetime.datetime(2047, 1, 1, 8, 21), (u'Today is ', u' ', u'at '))

    :return:
        Returns a :class:`datetime.datetime` object or, if the
        ``fuzzy_with_tokens`` option is ``True``, returns a tuple, the
        first element being a :class:`datetime.datetime` object, the second
        a tuple containing the fuzzy tokens.

    :raises ValueError:
        Raised for invalid or unknown string format, if the provided
        :class:`tzinfo` is not in a valid format, or if an invalid date
        would be created.

    :raises OverflowError:
        Raised if the parsed date exceeds the largest valid C integer on
        your system.

This module offers a generic date/time string parser which is able to parse
most known formats to represent a date and/or time.

This module attempts to be forgiving with regards to unlikely input formats,
returning a datetime object even for dates which are ambiguous. If an element
of a date/time stamp is omitted, the following rules are applied:

- If AM or PM is left unspecified, a 24-hour clock is assumed, however, an hour
  on a 12-hour clock (``0 <= hour <= 12``) *must* be specified if AM or PM is
  specified.
- If a time zone is omitted, a timezone-naive datetime is returned.

If any other elements are missing, they are taken from the
:class:`datetime.datetime` object passed to the parameter ``default``. If this
results in a day number exceeding the valid number of days per month, the
value falls back to the end of the month.

        This function breaks the time string into lexical units (tokens), which
        can be parsed by the parser. Lexical units are demarcated by changes in
        the character set, so any continuous string of letters is considered
        one unit, any continuous string of numbers is considered one unit.

        The main complication arises from the fact that dots ('.') can be used
        both as separators (e.g. "Sep.20.2009") or decimal points (e.g.
        "4:30:21.447"). As such, it is necessary to read the full context of
        any dot-separated strings before breaking it into tokens; as such, this
        function maintains a "token stack", for when the ambiguous context
        demands that multiple tokens be parsed at once.

    Class which handles what inputs are accepted. Subclass this to customize
    the language and acceptable values for each parameter.

    :param dayfirst:
        Whether to interpret the first value in an ambiguous 3-integer date
        (e.g. 01/05/09) as the day (``True``) or month (``False``). If
        ``yearfirst`` is set to ``True``, this distinguishes between YDM
        and YMD. Default is ``False``.

    :param yearfirst:
        Whether to interpret the first value in an ambiguous 3-integer date
        (e.g. 01/05/09) as the year. If ``True``, the first number is taken
        to be the year, otherwise the last number is taken to be the year.
        Default is ``False``.

        Parse the date/time string into a :class:`datetime.datetime` object.

        :param timestr:
            Any date/time string using the supported formats.

        :param default:
            The default datetime object, if this is a datetime object and not
            ``None``, elements specified in ``timestr`` replace elements in the
            default object.

        :param ignoretz:
            If set ``True``, time zones in parsed strings are ignored and a
            naive :class:`datetime.datetime` object is returned.

        :param tzinfos:
            Additional time zone names / aliases which may be present in the
            string. This argument maps time zone names (and optionally offsets
            from those time zones) to time zones. This parameter can be a
            dictionary with timezone aliases mapping time zone names to time
            zones or a function taking two parameters (``tzname`` and
            ``tzoffset``) and returning a time zone.

            The timezones to which the names are mapped can be an integer
            offset from UTC in seconds or a :class:`tzinfo` object.

            .. doctest::
               :options: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

                >>> from dateutil.parser import parse
                >>> from dateutil.tz import gettz
                >>> tzinfos = {"BRST": -7200, "CST": gettz("America/Chicago")}
                >>> parse("2012-01-19 17:21:00 BRST", tzinfos=tzinfos)
                datetime.datetime(2012, 1, 19, 17, 21, tzinfo=tzoffset(u'BRST', -7200))
                >>> parse("2012-01-19 17:21:00 CST", tzinfos=tzinfos)
                datetime.datetime(2012, 1, 19, 17, 21,
                                  tzinfo=tzfile('/usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Chicago'))

            This parameter is ignored if ``ignoretz`` is set.

        :param \*\*kwargs:
            Keyword arguments as passed to ``_parse()``.

        :return:
            Returns a :class:`datetime.datetime` object or, if the
            ``fuzzy_with_tokens`` option is ``True``, returns a tuple, the
            first element being a :class:`datetime.datetime` object, the second
            a tuple containing the fuzzy tokens.

        :raises ValueError:
            Raised for invalid or unknown string format, if the provided
            :class:`tzinfo` is not in a valid format, or if an invalid date
            would be created.

        :raises TypeError:
            Raised for non-string or character stream input.

        :raises OverflowError:
            Raised if the parsed date exceeds the largest valid C integer on
            your system.

        Private method which performs the heavy lifting of parsing, called from
        ``parse()``, which passes on its ``kwargs`` to this function.

        :param timestr:
            The string to parse.

        :param dayfirst:
            Whether to interpret the first value in an ambiguous 3-integer date
            (e.g. 01/05/09) as the day (``True``) or month (``False``). If
            ``yearfirst`` is set to ``True``, this distinguishes between YDM
            and YMD. If set to ``None``, this value is retrieved from the
            current :class:`parserinfo` object (which itself defaults to
            ``False``).

        :param yearfirst:
            Whether to interpret the first value in an ambiguous 3-integer date
            (e.g. 01/05/09) as the year. If ``True``, the first number is taken
            to be the year, otherwise the last number is taken to be the year.
            If this is set to ``None``, the value is retrieved from the current
            :class:`parserinfo` object (which itself defaults to ``False``).

        :param fuzzy:
            Whether to allow fuzzy parsing, allowing for string like "Today is
            January 1, 2047 at 8:21:00AM".

        :param fuzzy_with_tokens:
            If ``True``, ``fuzzy`` is automatically set to True, and the parser
            will return a tuple where the first element is the parsed
            :class:`datetime.datetime` datetimestamp and the second element is
            a tuple containing the portions of the string which were ignored:

            .. doctest::

                >>> from dateutil.parser import parse
                >>> parse("Today is January 1, 2047 at 8:21:00AM", fuzzy_with_tokens=True)
                (datetime.datetime(2047, 1, 1, 8, 21), (u'Today is ', u' ', u'at '))

    Parse a string in one of the supported formats, using the
    ``parserinfo`` parameters.

    :param timestr:
        A string containing a date/time stamp.

    :param parserinfo:
        A :class:`parserinfo` object containing parameters for the parser.
        If ``None``, the default arguments to the :class:`parserinfo`
        constructor are used.

    The ``**kwargs`` parameter takes the following keyword arguments:

    :param default:
        The default datetime object, if this is a datetime object and not
        ``None``, elements specified in ``timestr`` replace elements in the
        default object.

    :param ignoretz:
        If set ``True``, time zones in parsed strings are ignored and a naive
        :class:`datetime` object is returned.

    :param tzinfos:
        Additional time zone names / aliases which may be present in the
        string. This argument maps time zone names (and optionally offsets
        from those time zones) to time zones. This parameter can be a
        dictionary with timezone aliases mapping time zone names to time
        zones or a function taking two parameters (``tzname`` and
        ``tzoffset``) and returning a time zone.

        The timezones to which the names are mapped can be an integer
        offset from UTC in seconds or a :class:`tzinfo` object.

        .. doctest::
           :options: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

            >>> from dateutil.parser import parse
            >>> from dateutil.tz import gettz
            >>> tzinfos = {"BRST": -7200, "CST": gettz("America/Chicago")}
            >>> parse("2012-01-19 17:21:00 BRST", tzinfos=tzinfos)
            datetime.datetime(2012, 1, 19, 17, 21, tzinfo=tzoffset(u'BRST', -7200))
            >>> parse("2012-01-19 17:21:00 CST", tzinfos=tzinfos)
            datetime.datetime(2012, 1, 19, 17, 21,
                              tzinfo=tzfile('/usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Chicago'))

        This parameter is ignored if ``ignoretz`` is set.

    :param dayfirst:
        Whether to interpret the first value in an ambiguous 3-integer date
        (e.g. 01/05/09) as the day (``True``) or month (``False``). If
        ``yearfirst`` is set to ``True``, this distinguishes between YDM and
        YMD. If set to ``None``, this value is retrieved from the current
        :class:`parserinfo` object (which itself defaults to ``False``).

    :param yearfirst:
        Whether to interpret the first value in an ambiguous 3-integer date
        (e.g. 01/05/09) as the year. If ``True``, the first number is taken to
        be the year, otherwise the last number is taken to be the year. If
        this is set to ``None``, the value is retrieved from the current
        :class:`parserinfo` object (which itself defaults to ``False``).

    :param fuzzy:
        Whether to allow fuzzy parsing, allowing for string like "Today is
        January 1, 2047 at 8:21:00AM".

    :param fuzzy_with_tokens:
        If ``True``, ``fuzzy`` is automatically set to True, and the parser
        will return a tuple where the first element is the parsed
        :class:`datetime.datetime` datetimestamp and the second element is
        a tuple containing the portions of the string which were ignored:

        .. doctest::

            >>> from dateutil.parser import parse
            >>> parse("Today is January 1, 2047 at 8:21:00AM", fuzzy_with_tokens=True)
            (datetime.datetime(2047, 1, 1, 8, 21), (u'Today is ', u' ', u'at '))

    :return:
        Returns a :class:`datetime.datetime` object or, if the
        ``fuzzy_with_tokens`` option is ``True``, returns a tuple, the
        first element being a :class:`datetime.datetime` object, the second
        a tuple containing the fuzzy tokens.

    :raises ValueError:
        Raised for invalid or unknown string format, if the provided
        :class:`tzinfo` is not in a valid format, or if an invalid date
        would be created.

    :raises OverflowError:
        Raised if the parsed date exceeds the largest valid C integer on
        your system.

        Parse an ISO-8601 datetime string into a :class:`datetime.datetime`.

        An ISO-8601 datetime string consists of a date portion, followed
        optionally by a time portion - the date and time portions are separated
        by a single character separator, which is ``T`` in the official
        standard. Incomplete date formats (such as ``YYYY-MM``) may *not* be
        combined with a time portion.

        Supported date formats are:

        Common:

        - ``YYYY``
        - ``YYYY-MM`` or ``YYYYMM``
        - ``YYYY-MM-DD`` or ``YYYYMMDD``

        Uncommon:

        - ``YYYY-Www`` or ``YYYYWww`` - ISO week (day defaults to 0)
        - ``YYYY-Www-D`` or ``YYYYWwwD`` - ISO week and day

        The ISO week and day numbering follows the same logic as
        :func:`datetime.date.isocalendar`.

        Supported time formats are:

        - ``hh``
        - ``hh:mm`` or ``hhmm``
        - ``hh:mm:ss`` or ``hhmmss``
        - ``hh:mm:ss.sss`` or ``hh:mm:ss.ssssss`` (3-6 sub-second digits)

        Midnight is a special case for `hh`, as the standard supports both
        00:00 and 24:00 as a representation.

        .. caution::

            Support for fractional components other than seconds is part of the
            ISO-8601 standard, but is not currently implemented in this parser.

        Supported time zone offset formats are:

        - `Z` (UTC)
        - `HH:MM`
        - `HHMM`
        - `HH`

        Offsets will be represented as :class:`dateutil.tz.tzoffset` objects,
        with the exception of UTC, which will be represented as
        :class:`dateutil.tz.tzutc`. Time zone offsets equivalent to UTC (such
        as `+00:00`) will also be represented as :class:`dateutil.tz.tzutc`.

        :param dt_str:
            A string or stream containing only an ISO-8601 datetime string

        :return:
            Returns a :class:`datetime.datetime` representing the string.
            Unspecified components default to their lowest value.

        .. warning::

            As of version 2.7.0, the strictness of the parser should not be
            considered a stable part of the contract. Any valid ISO-8601 string
            that parses correctly with the default settings will continue to
            parse correctly in future versions, but invalid strings that
            currently fail (e.g. ``2017-01-01T00:00+00:00:00``) are not
            guaranteed to continue failing in future versions if they encode
            a valid date.

        Wrapper for :func:`ZoneInfoFile.zones.get`. This is a convenience method
        for retrieving zones from the zone dictionary.

        :param name:
            The name of the zone to retrieve. (Generally IANA zone names)

        :param default:
            The value to return in the event of a missing key.

    This is a convenience function which provides a :class:`ZoneInfoFile`
    instance using the data provided by the ``dateutil`` package. By default, it
    caches a single instance of the ZoneInfoFile object and returns that.

    :param new_instance:
        If ``True``, a new instance of :class:`ZoneInfoFile` is instantiated and
        used as the cached instance for the next call. Otherwise, new instances
        are created only as necessary.

    :return:
        Returns a :class:`ZoneInfoFile` object.

    This retrieves a time zone from the local zoneinfo tarball that is packaged
    with dateutil.

    :param name:
        An IANA-style time zone name, as found in the zoneinfo file.

    :return:
        Returns a :class:`dateutil.tz.tzfile` time zone object.

    .. warning::
        It is generally inadvisable to use this function, and it is only
        provided for API compatibility with earlier versions. This is *not*
        equivalent to ``dateutil.tz.gettz()``, which selects an appropriate
        time zone based on the inputs, favoring system zoneinfo. This is ONLY
        for accessing the dateutil-specific zoneinfo (which may be out of
        date compared to the system zoneinfo).

    .. deprecated:: 2.6
        If you need to use a specific zoneinfofile over the system zoneinfo,
        instantiate a :class:`dateutil.zoneinfo.ZoneInfoFile` object and call
        :func:`dateutil.zoneinfo.ZoneInfoFile.get(name)` instead.

        Use :func:`get_zonefile_instance` to retrieve an instance of the
        dateutil-provided zoneinfo.
    zzoneinfo.gettz() will be removed in future versions, to use the dateutil-provided zoneinfo files, instantiate a ZoneInfoFile object and use ZoneInfoFile.zones.get() instead. See the documentation for details.r   )

        The `dateutil` module provides powerful extensions to
        the standard `datetime` module, available in Python.
        
        
        Download
        ========
        dateutil is available on PyPI
        https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/
        
        The documentation is hosted at:
        https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
        
        Code
        ====
        The code and issue tracker are hosted on Github:
        https://github.com/dateutil/dateutil/
        
        Features
        ========
        
        * Computing of relative deltas (next month, next year,
          next monday, last week of month, etc);
        * Computing of relative deltas between two given
          date and/or datetime objects;
        * Computing of dates based on very flexible recurrence rules,
          using a superset of the `iCalendar <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt>`_
          specification. Parsing of RFC strings is supported as well.
        * Generic parsing of dates in almost any string format;
        * Timezone (tzinfo) implementations for tzfile(5) format
          files (/etc/localtime, /usr/share/zoneinfo, etc), TZ
          environment string (in all known formats), iCalendar
          format files, given ranges (with help from relative deltas),
          local machine timezone, fixed offset timezone, UTC timezone,
          and Windows registry-based time zones.
        * Internal up-to-date world timezone information based on
          Olson's database.
        * Computing of Easter Sunday dates for any given year,
          using Western, Orthodox or Julian algorithms;
        * A comprehensive test suite.
        
        Quick example
        =============
        Here's a snapshot, just to give an idea about the power of the
        package. For more examples, look at the documentation.
        
        Suppose you want to know how much time is left, in
        years/months/days/etc, before the next easter happening on a
        year with a Friday 13th in August, and you want to get today's
        date out of the "date" unix system command. Here is the code:
        
        .. code-block:: python3
        
            >>> from dateutil.relativedelta import *
            >>> from dateutil.easter import *
            >>> from dateutil.rrule import *
            >>> from dateutil.parser import *
            >>> from datetime import *
            >>> now = parse("Sat Oct 11 17:13:46 UTC 2003")
            >>> today = now.date()
            >>> year = rrule(YEARLY,dtstart=now,bymonth=8,bymonthday=13,byweekday=FR)[0].year
            >>> rdelta = relativedelta(easter(year), today)
            >>> print("Today is: %s" % today)
            Today is: 2003-10-11
            >>> print("Year with next Aug 13th on a Friday is: %s" % year)
            Year with next Aug 13th on a Friday is: 2004
            >>> print("How far is the Easter of that year: %s" % rdelta)
            How far is the Easter of that year: relativedelta(months=+6)
            >>> print("And the Easter of that year is: %s" % (today+rdelta))
            And the Easter of that year is: 2004-04-11
        
        Being exactly 6 months ahead was **really** a coincidence :)
