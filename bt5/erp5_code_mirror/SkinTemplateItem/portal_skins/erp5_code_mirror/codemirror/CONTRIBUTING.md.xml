\n
- [Getting help](#getting-help)\n
- [Submitting bug reports](#submitting-bug-reports)\n
- [Contributing code](#contributing-code)\n
\n
## Getting help\n
\n
Community discussion, questions, and informal bug reporting is done on the\n
[discuss.CodeMirror forum](http://discuss.codemirror.net).\n
\n
## Submitting bug reports\n
\n
The preferred way to report bugs is to use the\n
[GitHub issue tracker](http://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/issues). Before\n
reporting a bug, read these pointers.\n
\n
**Note:** The issue tracker is for *bugs*, not requests for help. Questions\n
should be asked on the\n
[discuss.CodeMirror forum](http://discuss.codemirror.net) instead.\n
\n
### Reporting bugs effectively\n
\n
- CodeMirror is maintained by volunteers. They don\'t owe you anything, so be\n
  polite. Reports with an indignant or belligerent tone tend to be moved to the\n
  bottom of the pile.\n
\n
- Include information about **the browser in which the problem occurred**. Even\n
  if you tested several browsers, and the problem occurred in all of them,\n
  mention this fact in the bug report. Also include browser version numbers and\n
  the operating system that you\'re on.\n
\n
- Mention which release of CodeMirror you\'re using. Preferably, try also with\n
  the current development snapshot, to ensure the problem has not already been\n
  fixed.\n
\n
- Mention very precisely what went wrong. "X is broken" is not a good bug\n
  report. What did you expect to happen? What happened instead? Describe the\n
  exact steps a maintainer has to take to make the problem occur. We can not\n
  fix something that we can not observe.\n
\n
- If the problem can not be reproduced in any of the demos included in the\n
  CodeMirror distribution, please provide an HTML document that demonstrates\n
  the problem. The best way to do this is to go to\n
  [jsbin.com](http://jsbin.com/ihunin/edit), enter it there, press save, and\n
  include the resulting link in your bug report.\n
\n
## Contributing code\n
\n
- Make sure you have a [GitHub Account](https://github.com/signup/free)\n
- Fork [CodeMirror](https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/)\n
  ([how to fork a repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo))\n
- Make your changes\n
- If your changes are easy to test or likely to regress, add tests.\n
  Tests for the core go into `test/test.js`, some modes have their own\n
  test suite under `mode/XXX/test.js`. Feel free to add new test\n
  suites to modes that don\'t have one yet (be sure to link the new\n
  tests into `test/index.html`).\n
- Follow the general code style of the rest of the project (see\n
  below). Run `bin/lint` to verify that the linter is happy.\n
- Make sure all tests pass. Visit `test/index.html` in your browser to\n
  run them.\n
- Submit a pull request\n
([how to create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)).\n
  Don\'t put more than one feature/fix in a single pull request.\n
\n
By contributing code to CodeMirror you\n
\n
 - agree to license the contributed code under CodeMirror\'s [MIT\n
   license](http://codemirror.net/LICENSE).\n
\n
 - confirm that you have the right to contribute and license the code\n
   in question. (Either you hold all rights on the code, or the rights\n
   holder has explicitly granted the right to use it like this,\n
   through a compatible open source license or through a direct\n
   agreement with you.)\n
\n
### Coding standards\n
\n
- 2 spaces per indentation level, no tabs.\n
\n
- Note that the linter (`bin/lint`) which is run after each commit\n
  complains about unused variables and functions. Prefix their names\n
  with an underscore to muffle it.\n
\n
- CodeMirror does *not* follow JSHint or JSLint prescribed style.\n
  Patches that try to \'fix\' code to pass one of these linters will be\n
  unceremoniously discarded.\n
