  """Delivery Solver interface specification

  This interface must be implemented by all delivery solvers which are
  used to solve quantity related divergences in ERP5 simulation.
  Delivery solvers are usually built by SolverTool and invoked by target
  solvers.

  Delivery solvers are initialised with a list of simulation movements
  and provide methods (setQuantity, getQuantity) to manipulate the total
  quantity of movements.

    average, least cost)
