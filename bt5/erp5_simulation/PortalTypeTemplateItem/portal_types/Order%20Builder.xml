            <value> <string>    Delivery Builder objects allow to gather multiple Simulation Movements\n
    into a single Delivery. \n
\n
    The initial quantity property of the Delivery Line is calculated by\n
    summing quantities of related Simulation Movements.\n
\n
    Delivery Builders are called for example whenever an order is confirmed.\n
    They are also called globaly in order to gather any confirmed or above \n
    Simulation Movement which was not associated to any Delivery Line. \n
    Such movements are called orphaned Simulation Movements.\n
\n
    Delivery Builder objects are provided with a set a parameters to achieve \n
    their goal:\n
\n
    A path definition: source, destination, etc. which defines the general \n
    kind of movements it applies.\n
\n
    simulation_select_method which defines how to query all Simulation \n
    Movements which meet certain criteria (including the above path path \n
    definition).\n
\n
    collect_order_list which defines how to group selected movements \n
    according to gathering rules.\n
\n
    delivery_select_method which defines how to select existing Delivery \n
    which may eventually be updated with selected simulation movements.\n
\n
    delivery_module, delivery_type and delivery_line_type which define the \n
    module and portal types for newly built Deliveries and Delivery Lines.\n
\n
    Delivery Builders can also be provided with optional parameters to \n
    restrict selection to a given root Applied Rule caused by a single Order\n
    or to Simulation Movements related to a limited set of existing \n
    Deliveries.\n
