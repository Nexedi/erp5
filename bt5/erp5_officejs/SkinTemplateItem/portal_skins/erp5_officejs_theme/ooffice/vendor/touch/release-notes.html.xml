            Release Notes: Release Notes: October 12, 2012<br>\n
            Version Number: 2.1.0-rc2\n

        <div style="margin: 10px">\n
            <p>We are now preparing for the final GA release of Touch 2.1.  Until then we will be\n
            focusing on bug fixing, documentation, and performance tweaks.</p>\n
            <p>A DOM change was made to ListItems to improve performance by removing a level\n
            of box nesting. If you use a header with a custom height you will need to set\n
            that height in the sass For example:\n
            <p>\n
            <pre>\n
                .x-list-normal {\n
                  &.x-list-grouped .x-list-header-wrap .x-dock-horizontal {\n
                      padding-top: 26px;\n
                  }\n
                }\n
            </pre>\n
            <p>\n
            In addition if you were targeting ".x-list-item .x-dock-vertical", this will change to\n
            ".x-list-item .x-dock-horizontal".\n
            </p>\n
        </div>\n
\n
        <ul>\n
            <li>Enhancements/Changes\n
                <ul>\n
                    <li>Change ListItems to not use vertical docking for headers. This improves performance since there is less DOM and less box layouts</li>\n
                    <li>SVG is now forced on Android 4.1 devices due to Canvas <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=37529" target="_blank">issues</a></li>\n

                    <li>[TOUCH-3551] Added filtering and sorting capabilities to the SQL proxy</li>\n

                    <li>Ensure the processed records are applied to the ResultSet in Operation</li>\n

                </ul>\n
            </li>\n

            Release Notes: Release Notes: September 10, 2012<br>\n
            Version Number: 2.1.0-b3\n

            <p><strong>\n
                The new List component is included with this release.  This implementation replaces the old\n
                one for lists and is no longer bound one-to-one between a store and DOM elements. This means that\n
                the length of the list will no longer have a bearing on it\'s scrolling performance.  In addition,\n
                lists can use components if you specify them with an itemConfig and itemTpl will be converted\n
                to an itemConfig dynamically if you specify one.  Due to these changes, the DOM structure was altered\n
                for lists and you may need to change some css selectors to add appropriate styling for your lists.\n
                Typically you need to change the selector from \'.x-list-item\' to \'.x-list-item > .x-dock-vertical > .x-dock-body\'\n
                for any padding or margins you may have added. We have change the TouchTweets example from using a\n
                component based DataView to the new List very easily and should be a good example of using the\n
                new List component with dynamic large lists.\n
            </strong></p>\n
            <p><strong>\n
                We are releasing an update to Sencha Command and the Native Packager. This includes many bugfixes and\n
                enhancements including:\n
                    <ul>\n
                        <li>in-app purchases API for iOS</li>\n
                        <li>Contacts APIs for iOS and Android</li>\n
                        <li>Push notifications for iOS</li>\n
                        <li>openURL support</li>\n
                    </ul>\n
                The Native packages are also now plugin based and includes an API for developers to write their own\n
                plugins.\n
            </strong></p>\n
            <p><strong>\n
                We continue to add more to charting, and this release includes some of the labeling, grouped bar charts,\n
                axis titles, and more.  We want the next release for charting to be feature complete so expect the last chart types\n
                and missing functionality to be added soon.\n
            </strong></p>\n
            <p><strong>\n
                Once again, thank you for all the reported issues, we have fixed many bugs for this release and\n
                continue to work hard on them.  The major changes are now in place and we are continuing to work on\n
                performance enhancements and bug fixes until the release is ready.\n

            <p><strong>\n
                This is the initial beta for Touch 2.1 which is focused on the new charting\n
                package as well as bug fixes. The charting package has had a major rewrite and includes SVG support\n
                on devices which can support it.  Most devices perform faster with Canvas and will use that engine\n
                by default.  We will be adding more charting types and other missing functionality in charts\n
                throughout the beta cycle. The next release will be more focused on performance enhancements\n
                with updates to the layouts and events.\n
            </strong></p>\n

            <p><b>Special Notes:</b></p>\n
            <p><b>If you are using a LocalStorage proxy, from now on your Model\'s <i>identifier</i> strategy must generate unique id\'s.\n
                We suggest you use the included UUID strategy by adding <i>identifier: \'uuid\'</i> to your Model definition. Any existing\n
                Models you have saved to LocalStorage will need to have this added. A warning will be thrown for any Model configured\n
                with a LocalStorage proxy that doesn\'t have a unique id generating strategy.</b></p>\n
            <p>The <strong>change</strong> event in <i>Ext.field.Select</i> has been changed to return the new and old\n
                values and not records. This is to make it more consistent with all other form fields.</p>\n
            <p>The <strong>change</strong> event in <i>Ext.field.Slider</i> has been changed event now passes the Slider component</p>\n
            <p>Removed the default Ext.MessageBox requirement, added a proper error when Ext.Msg is used without Ext.MessageBox the requirement</p>\n
            <p>Refactored NavigationBar.  NavigationBar now extends TitleBar and has ellipsis support. Animations in NavigationView on Android are now supported</p>\n
            <p>Optimized Card Layout with extra absolute position wrapper, improves performance in complex applications and when docking items to the left/right</p>\n
            <p>Implemented a new default ui for the radio field</p>\n
            <p>Revamped Command, removed all binaries (now reside in SDK Tools installations entirely)</p>\n

\n
            <p>Application dependency logic has been tweaked to allow more versatility in specifying dependencies from\n
                packages outside your application. As of this release any combination of local and external dependencies\n
                should be possible, but you\'ll need use Ext.Loader.setPath to specify where external dependencies can be\n
                found. See the <a href="http://docs.sencha.com/touch/2-0/#!/api/Ext.app.Application">updated Application\n
                    class docs</a> for sample usage.</p>\n

            <p><b>Notes:</b></p>\n
\n
            <p>Navigation View has been updated so the \'stack\' is now based on the <b>items</b> config/collection. This\n
                means that if you define more than 1 item in a navigation view, the last item will <i>always</i> be the\n
                active item. The animation methods have also been removed from Navigaiton View. Instead, you should change\n
                the animation using the view.getLayout().setAnimation() setter instead, just like you would on a\n
                Ext.Container.</p>\n
\n
            <p>The signature returned in the <b>callback</b> configuration of <b>Ext.util.JSONP#request</b> has changed.\n
                Previously it only returned the JSON object. It now returns the success value (Boolean) as the first\n
                argument and then the JSON object as the second argument. The class has also been deprecated</p>\n
\n
            <p>The sencha-touch-debug.js shipped with Beta 2 now includes deprecated compatibility methods. Please remember\n
                that in order to use the smaller build without compatibility, you will need to fix any deprecation warnings\n
                you receive during development</p>\n
        </div>\n

        Release Notes: Release Notes: January 23, 2012<br>\n
        Version Number: 2.0.0.pr4\n
    </p>\n
    <ul>\n
        <li>Enhancements/Changes\n
            <ul>\n
                <li>Added 7 new guides, including a <a href="docs/#!/guide/upgrade_1_to_2">1.x -> 2.x Migration Guide</a>\n
                </li>\n
                <li>Data refactored:\n
                    <ul>\n
                        <li>The data packed now makes full use of the config system and we recommend that configs be\n
                            used with the data package as with the rest of your applications.\n
                        </li>\n
                        <li>The performance of the data package has been signifigantly improved.</li>\n
                        <li>There are some event changes in the Data package and backwards compatibility for the old add,\n
                            update,\n
                            and remove events is not fully in place. The old events have severe performance implications and\n
                            we strongly recommend all developers change to the new addrecords, updaterecord, and\n
                            removerecords.\n
                            In addition we have added a new \'refresh event\' to supplant the old \'datachanged event\' which\n
                            was\n
                            fired under too many circumstances.\n
                        </li>\n
                        <li>Many issues with LocalStore/WebStore are resolved and this should now work properly.\n
                            Please note that assosciated local stores are not in place yet.\n
                        </li>\n
                        <li>Store paging is back in place and operational.</li>\n
                    </ul>\n
                </li>\n
                <li>MVC refactored:\n
                    <ul>\n
                        <li>All MVC classes now consolidated under the Ext.app.* namespace</li>\n
                        <li>All classes now use the 2.x class and config system</li>\n
                        <li>Routes can now be defined on Controllers</li>\n
                        <li>The Router from 1.x has been reinstated</li>\n
                        <li>Device Profiles are now able to load their own dependencies if activated</li>\n
                        <li>\n
                            Added 3 new guides - <a href="docs/#!/guide/apps_intro">Intro to apps</a>,\n
                            <a href="docs/#!/guide/controllers">Controllers</a> and <a href="docs/#!/guide/profiles">Device\n
                            Profiles</a>\n
                        </li>\n
                        <li>Kitchen Sink updated to use device profiles, history and deep linking support</li>\n

                </li>\n
                <li>ComponentView refactored:\n
                    <ul>\n
                        <li>ComponentView is now fully integrated into DataView and it turned on by using the useComponents:\n
                            true flag as a configuration option\n
                        </li>\n
                        <li>The event signatures for DataView have been changed to handle both Element based items and\n
                            Component based items. In addition the record is now passed on all the item events.\n
                        </li>\n
                    </ul>\n
                </li>\n
