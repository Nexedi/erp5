\n
## Installation\n
\n
[Compass Recipes is available as a gem on RubyGems.org](https://rubygems.org/gems/compass-recipes), so installation is quite easy.\n
\n
```shell\n
gem install compass-recipes\n
```\n
\n
*If you want all latests recipes, you can just checkout the recipes (or download as zip) and add \'{your-path-here-or-./}compass-recipes/stylesheets\' using `additional_import_paths` or `add_import_path` (see [Compass configuration reference](http://compass-style.org/help/tutorials/configuration-reference/)*\n
\n
# Usage\n
\n
When compass-recipes installed, you just need to require the compass plugin in your project\n
\n
```css\n
require \'compass-recipes\'\n
```\n
\n
Then you can include some recipes like this\n
\n
```css\n
@import "recipes/shape/triangle";\n
.my-triangle\n
{\n
    @include triangle;\n
}\n
```\n
\n
Like Compass does, you can include all recipes in a folder like this\n
\n
```css\n
@import "recipes/shape";\n
\n
.my-triangle\n
{\n
    @include triangle;\n
}\n
\n
.my-square\n
{\n
    @include square;\n
}\n
```\n
\n
## Authors/Maintainers\n
 \n
Compass Recipes is maintained by [Maxime Thirouin](http://moox.fr), a front-end web developer at [Shopbot](http://shopbot-inc.com), and [David Kaneda](http://www.davidkaneda.com), creative director at [Sencha](http://www.sencha.com).\n
\n
### Sous Chefs\n
\n
While Maxime and David are the primary project maintainers, these people have provided lots of the core ideas and techniques in the recipes. They are the bacon in our BLT: [@simurai](http://twitter.com/simurai), [@chriscoyier](http://twitter.com/chriscoyier), [@leaverou](http://twitter.com/leaverou), [@necolas](http://twitter.com/necolas).\n
\n
## Open to All\n
\n
If you have a nifty CSS trick that makes sense to be abstracted (and isn\'t already in another Github repo), please fork and submit a pull request. Note: If you are not the author of the CSS trick, you must get their permission before adding.\n
\n
## Build Documentation\n
\n
First you need bundle\n
\n
```bundle install```\n
\n
Then, to build the gh-pages from the `tests/`, you need to call\n
\n
```bundle exec rake pages```\n
\n
## Additional Resources\n
\n
Some other great CSS/SCSS/design projects for making delicious websites:\n
\n
* [Normalize](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/) - The standard of CSS normalizations.\n
* [Subtle Patterns](http://subtlepatterns.com/) - Great collection of free background patterns, some of which are not possible with CSS alone.\n
