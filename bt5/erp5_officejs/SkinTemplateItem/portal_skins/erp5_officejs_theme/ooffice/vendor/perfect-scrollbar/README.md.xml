perfect-scrollbar\n
=================\n
\n
Tiny but perfect jQuery scrollbar plugin\n
\n
Why perfect-scrollbar?\n
------------------\n
\n
I worked on the personal project recently, and I was trying to find the jQuery scrollbar plugin that\'s *perfect*. But there was no *perfect* scrollbar plugin. That\'s why I decided to make one.\n
\n
perfect-scrollbar is very tiny but *perfect*(for me, and maybe for the most of developers) jQuery scrollbar plugin.  \n
I hope you love this!\n
\n
Demo: http://noraesae.github.com/perfect-scrollbar/\n
\n
What means *perfect*?\n
---------------------\n
\n
*perfect* means...\n
\n
* There should be no css change on any original element.\n
* The scrollbar should not affect the original design layout.\n
* The design of the scrollbar should be (nearly) fully customizable.\n
* If the size of the container or the content changes, the scrollbar size and position should be able to change.\n
\n
Then perfect-scrollbar is really *perfect*?\n
-------------------------------------------\n
\n
Yes! the only thing that\'s not *perfect* is my English.\n
\n
* perfect-scrollbar has some requirements, but doesn\'t change or add any style on original elements.\n
* perfect-scrollbar is designed not to have width or height. It\'s fixed on the right and bottom side of the container.\n
* You can change nearly all css styles of the scrollbar. The scrollbar design has no dependency on scripts.\n
* perfect-scrollbar support \'update\' function. Whenever you need to update the size or position of the scrollbar, just update.\n
* Additionally, perfect-scrollbar do use \'scrollTop\' and \'scrollLeft\', not absolute position or something messy.\n
\n
It\'s cool, isn\'t it?\n
\n
Install\n
-------\n
\n
You can download the latest stable version with download links in [Github Page](http://noraesae.github.io/perfect-scrollbar/). You also can find all releases in [Releases](https://github.com/noraesae/perfect-scrollbar/releases) page.\n
\n
If you want to use the development version of the plugin, use the source files which are not minified. They\'re in the `src` directory. The development version may be unstable, but some known bugs can be fixed.\n
\n
```\n
git clone https://github.com/noraesae/perfect-scrollbar.git\n
cd perfect-scrollbar/src\n
```\n
\n
You can use [Bower](http://bower.io/) to install the plugin. The plugin is registered as `perfect-scrollbar`.\n
\n
```\n
bower install perfect-scrollbar\n
```\n
\n
Requirements\n
------------\n
\n
To make this plugin *perfect*, some requirements were not avoidable. But they\'re all very trivial and there\'s nothing to worry about.\n
\n
* the container must have a \'position\' css style.\n
* the container must have an \'overflow:hidden\' css style.\n
* the scrollbar\'s position must be \'absolute\'.\n
* the scrollbar-x must have a \'bottom\' css style, and the scrollbar-y must have a \'right\' css style.\n
\n
The requirement below is for perfect-scrollbar &lt;= 0.3.4\n
\n
* there must be the *one* content element(like div) for the container.\n
 \n
Optional parameters\n
-------------------\n
\n
perfect-scrollbar supports optional parameters.\n
\n
### wheelSpeed\n
The scroll speed applied to mousewheel event.  \n
**Default: 10**\n
\n
### wheelPropagation\n
If this option is true, when the scroll reach the end of the side, mousewheel event will be propagated to parent element.  \n
**Default: false**\n
\n
### minScrollbarLength\n
When set to an integer value, the thumb part of the scrollbar will not shrink below that number of pixels.  \n
**Default: null**\n
\n
### useBothWheelAxes\n
When set to true, and only one (vertical or horizontal) scrollbar is visible then both vertical and horizontal scrolling will affect the scrollbar.  \n
**Default: false**\n
\n
### useKeyboard\n
When set to true, the scroll works with arrow keys on the keyboard. The element is scrolled only when the mouse cursor hovers the element.  \n
**Default: true**\n
\n
### suppressScrollX\n
When set to true, the scroll bar in X axis will not be available, regardless of the content width.  \n
**Default: false**\n
\n
### suppressScrollY\n
When set to true, the scroll bar in Y axis will not be available, regardless of the content height.  \n
**Default: false**\n
\n
### scrollXMarginOffset\n
The number of pixels the content width can surpass the container width without enabling the X axis scroll bar. Allows some "wiggle room" or "offset break", so that X axis scroll bar is not enabled just because of a few pixels.  \n
**Default: 0**\n
\n
### scrollYMarginOffset\n
The number of pixels the content height can surpass the container height without enabling the Y axis scroll bar. Allows some "wiggle room" or "offset break", so that Y axis scroll bar is not enabled just because of a few pixels.  \n
**Default: 0**\n
\n
### includePadding\n
When set to true, it uses `innerWidth` and `innerHeight` for the container size instead of `width` and `height`. When your container element has non-zero padding and the scrollbar layout looks weird, this option can be helpful.  \n
**Default: false**\n
\n
How to Use\n
----------\n
\n
```html\n
<style>\n
  #Demo { position: \'relative\'; }\n
</style>\n
<div id=\'Demo\'>\n
  <div>\n
    ...\n
  </div>\n
</div>\n
```\n
When the html document is like above, just use like this:\n
```javascript\n
$(\'#Demo\').perfectScrollbar();\n
```\n
\n
With optional parameters:\n
```javascript\n
$("#Demo").perfectScrollbar({\n
  wheelSpeed: 20,\n
  wheelPropagation: true,\n
  minScrollbarLength: 20\n
})\n
```\n
\n
If the size of your container or content changes:\n
```javascript\n
$(\'#Demo\').perfectScrollbar(\'update\');\n
```\n
If you want to destory the scrollbar:\n
```javascript\n
$(\'#Demo\').perfectScrollbar(\'destroy\');\n
```\n
\n
If you want to scroll to somewhere, just use scroll-top css and update.\n
```javascript\n
$("#Demo").scrollTop(0);\n
$("#Demo").perfectScrollbar(\'update\');\n
```\n
\n
Also you can get the informations about how to use the plugin from example codes in the `examples` directory of the source tree.\n
\n
Very helpful friends\n
--------------------\n
\n
perfect-scrollbar supports [jquery-mousewheel](https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-mousewheel). If you want to use mousewheel features, please include jquery-mousewheel before using perfect-scrollbar.\n
\n
If you want to make this plugin\'s update function more responsive, [jquery-resize](https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-resize) can be helpful.\n

For IE problems, please refer to [IE Support](https://github.com/noraesae/perfect-scrollbar#ie-support)\n
\n
IE Support\n
----------\n
\n
This plugin supports old IE browsers in the **minimum** range. The plugin is tested in IEs >= IE6 and works(not well, but works).\n
\n
**But the project will not accept the patches to fix IE problems in IE 6/7/8.**\n
\n
From jQuery 2.0, jQuery also will not support IE 6/7/8. I also think that supporting old browsers really breaks the web development conventions.\n
\n
When old IEs should be supported, please fork the project and make patches personally.\n
