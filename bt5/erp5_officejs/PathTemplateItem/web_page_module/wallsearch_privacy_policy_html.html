<p>WallSearch Privacy Policy</p>

<p>Below are the terms for the privacy policy applicable when you use wallsearch.app.officejs.com</p>

<p>The application is entirely client-side except for the login process which requires interaction with the Facebook servers and post fetching which also requires communication with the Facebook servers. We don&#39;t collect or store any user related data on our servers. During the Facebook login we request the user&#39;s permission to access their Facebook posts, that&#39;s the only information we request from the Facebook servers. This happens on your computer and does not involve our servers. The application stores the Facebook posts on the user&#39;s computer in their Browsers database. For more details regarding how Facebook handles this data, please refer to their privacy policy. Our servers do log basic details such as IP address, date/time, etc for each request your browser makes.</p>
