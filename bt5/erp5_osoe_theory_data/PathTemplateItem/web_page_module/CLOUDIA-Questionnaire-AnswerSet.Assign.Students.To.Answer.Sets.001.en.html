          This tutorial illustrates the process of assigning students as peer reviewers to each other's answer set and to cloned templates.
          <br /> <br />
          Note: This action should be performed by the professor, and
          this action will only assign students who belong to the particular organisation and who have already submitted their own answer sets for peer review as peer reviewers. 
          <strong>Only perform the actions after all students have submitted their answer sets for peer review. The answer sets' state need to be &quot;Submitted For Peer Review&quot;, otherwise the actions won't work.</strong> </details> </section><section class="screenshot">

          Click on &quot;Modules&quot;, then choose &quot;Organisation&quot; module, or you can choose &quot;Organisation&quot; directly from the main page. When you are located at the organisation list page, choose the organisation which you and all the students belong to.

          At the organisation page, under &quot;Action&quot; menu, choose &quot;Assign Peer Reviewer to Answer Set&quot;. This action is used for assigning students as peer reviewers to each other's answer set.
          <br /> </details> </section><section class="screenshot"> 
    <h1>System message: Assigned</h1> <img type="image/svg+xml" src="http://img.erp5.cn/P-CLOUDIA-Configuration.Questionnaire.HowTo.Assign.Students.Assigned?format=png" /> <details open="true"> <br />
          If the action was performed sucessfully, you will see the system message &quot; Peer Reviewer assigned to Answer Sets&quot;.
          <br /> <strong>Note:</strong> There could be another system message displaying &quot;One or more students submitted more than one answer set, please archive duplicates before assign peer reviewer&quot;. Since this action assign students to each other's answer set as peer reviewer, and each student should only be the peer reviewer of one answer set, so this action cannot run if one student submitted his/her answer set twice. In this case, you need to archive the duplicate one before proceed with this action.

          If all the answer sets from the students, which are in the state &quot;submitted for peer review&quot; already have peer reviewers assigned to them, you will see the system message &quot;No Answer Set found to be assigned to Peer Reviewer&quot;.

          Now you can clone templates from master templates, and assign students as peer reviewers to the cloned templates. To do so, choose &quot;Clone Templates and Assign to Students&quot; from the &quot;Action&quot; drop-down menu.
          <br /> <br /> <strong>Note:</strong> the number of templates to clone will be calculated automatically  according to the number of the students, and students  will be assigned randomly to the  templates. The templates are cloned from the master templates.

          If the action was performed sucessfully, you will see the system message &quot;Templates cloned and assigned to students&quot;.
          <br /> <br /> <strong>Note:</strong> only the students who have already submitted their answer sets for peer review will be assigned to cloned templates. Be careful, this action checks whether a student has already been assigned to a template as a peer reviewer before.

          If the students have already been assigned to templates once, then you will see the system message &quot;All students have already been assigned to templates as Peer Reviewers&quot;.

          <br /> <br /> <strong>Note:</strong> you will also see the templates which are assigned to students. To distinguish students' own answer sets from the templates, you could check the person to see if he/she is a student from your organisation, or compare titles of the answer sets with the list of templates which has been provided to you, or just simply open one answer set to check whether the pattern is marked as &quot;Peer Review/ Template&quot;.
