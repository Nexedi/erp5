          <p>The objectives of the questionnaire are listed above.</p><p>The starting point is to analyze what the company's strong point is. This is necessary to prevent changes in this field. Additionally, asking about positive processes first results in a more open communication culture in the interview.</p><p>Secondly, the weak point has to be analyzed. This could be a process which is inefficient, redundant or over-sized. It is most important to provide an explicit description of the process with all relevant key questions.</p><p>Thirdly, ERP5 is used to improve the weak point of the organisation. The goal is to find and describe a possible future application area where ERP5 can be introduced.</p><p>The final goal is to provide the information about the facets of the company to enable the configuration sheets to be filled in.</p><p>To achieve all goals, all questions have to be checked for their answers' quality, explicitness and completeness.</p>
