<p>In this presentation, we are going to explain how this lecture was designed. First, we define the goals of the course and especially what students can expect to learn by attending the course. Second, we explain the organisation of the lecture as a sequence of theory and tutorials that cover the different aspects of an ERP. Last we introduce the student evaluation process based on a case study and questionnaire.</p>

<h1>Course Objectives</h1>

<ul>
	<li>Learn universal and fundamental workflow of companies</li>
	<li>Understand what is an ERP by practicing an ERP instance</li>
	<li>Learn to perform a consulting process for an ERP implementation</li>
	<li>Being capable of configuring an ERP</li>
</ul>

<details open="open">
<p>&quot;ERP: Theory, Practice and Configuration&quot; is a lesson which has four main goals.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The first one is to teach you the universal and fundamental workflow of the companies. By doing so, you will be able to understand how is organised any company and how ERP systems help companies to improve their performance by managing their business process.</li>
	<li>The second step is to see how the theoretical workflow is applied in an ERP. For this we will use ERP5 instances delivered to each student of this course. You will then be able to use it as companies do everyday.</li>
	<li>The third goal is to teach how to perform an initial consulting process for an ERP implementation. We will use an online questionnaire with the most important questions to ask to a company during this process. The objective of the questionnaire is to identify those business processes which are not successful enough and which can be improved using an ERP. The objective is to understand how to set the priorities for an ERP implementation.</li>
	<li>The fourth goal is to teach how to configure an ERP through the definition of so-called categories. Since the configuration is made through a spreadsheet, no programming skills are needed and the focus is kept on management and organization rather than on technical details.</li>

<p>During session one, we will see how to handle career and assignment in today&#39;s ERP systems.</p>

<p>These two notions &quot;Careers&quot; and &quot;Assignments&quot; are here to help people to manage human resources.</p>

<p>The career workflow is very simple since careers are made of career steps which come one after the other.</p>

<p>Assignments are a little bit different since a person can have many assignments in the same time.</p>

<p>Once career and assignment be studied, we will then spend time on the first five ERP5 Tutorials which are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>&quot;How to create Persons&quot; will teach you how to create a document in ERP5 which will represent the person.</li>

<p>Tickets are documents in ERP5 which can contain other documents such as Events or documents from the Document Management System (DMS).</p>

<p>Having such records will help you to organise and follow your interaction with persons outside the company. Specific workflows are applied to Tickets depending of their nature.</p>

<p>In ERP5 we have four kinds of Tickets: the Campaigns, the Sale Opportunities, the Support Requests and the Meetings. Each one will be studied during this session.</p>
