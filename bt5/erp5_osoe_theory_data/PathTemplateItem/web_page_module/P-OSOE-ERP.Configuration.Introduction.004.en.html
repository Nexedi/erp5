        <h1>Course Objectives</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Learn universal and fundamental workflow of companies</li>
          <li>Understand what is an ERP by practicing an ERP instance</li>
          <li>Learn to perform a consulting process for an ERP implementation</li>
          <li>Being capable of configuring an ERP</li>
        </ul>
        <details open="open">
          <p>"ERP: Theory, Practice and Configuration" is a lesson which has three main goals.</p><ul>
            <li>The first one is to teach you the universal and fundamental workflow of the companies. By doing so, you will be able to understand how is organised any company and how ERP systems help companies to improve their performance by managing their business process.</li>
            <li>The second step is to see how the theoretical workflow is applied in an ERP. For this we will use ERP5 instances delivered to each student of this course. You will then be able to use it as companies do everyday.</li>
            <li>The third goal is to teach how to perform an initial consulting process for an ERP implementation. We will use an online questionnaire with the most important questions to ask to a company during this process. The objective of the questionnaire is to identify those business processes which are not successful enough and which can be improved using an ERP. The objective is to understand how to set the priorities for an ERP implementation.</li>
            <li>The fourth goal is to teach how to configure an ERP through the definition of so-called categories. Since the configuration is made through a spreadsheet, no programming skills are needed and the focus is kept on management and organization rather than on technical details.</li>
