  This script returns the list of category (or tags) which are available in the current web section.
  It returns a python list of Category object. A Category object is really simple, as it has just 
  one property with a getter and a setter : title.

  TODO: XXX-JPS
  - this is way too slow - it will collapse the system
  - have a look at mailreader code - there is something doing the same
  - consider using virtual domains possibly - again look in email reader code

## First step : retrieve the raw list

subject_list = []

for item in current_section.WebSection_getDocumentValueList(): # XXX-JPS - this will fail for performance reasons
  subject_list.extend([x for x in item.getSubjectList() if not x in subject_list])

## Now, build the object list so that a Listbox can be used to display the results of this script.
