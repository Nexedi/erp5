            Release Notes: Release Notes: October 12, 2012<br>

            <p>We are now preparing for the final GA release of Touch 2.1.  Until then we will be
            focusing on bug fixing, documentation, and performance tweaks.</p>
            <p>A DOM change was made to ListItems to improve performance by removing a level
            of box nesting. If you use a header with a custom height you will need to set
            that height in the sass For example:
            <p>
            <pre>
                .x-list-normal {
                  &.x-list-grouped .x-list-header-wrap .x-dock-horizontal {
                      padding-top: 26px;
                  }
                }
            </pre>
            <p>
            In addition if you were targeting ".x-list-item .x-dock-vertical", this will change to
            ".x-list-item .x-dock-horizontal".
            </p>
        </div>

        <ul>

                <ul>

            <p><strong>
                The new List component is included with this release.  This implementation replaces the old
                one for lists and is no longer bound one-to-one between a store and DOM elements. This means that
                the length of the list will no longer have a bearing on it's scrolling performance.  In addition,
                lists can use components if you specify them with an itemConfig and itemTpl will be converted
                to an itemConfig dynamically if you specify one.  Due to these changes, the DOM structure was altered
                for lists and you may need to change some css selectors to add appropriate styling for your lists.
                Typically you need to change the selector from '.x-list-item' to '.x-list-item > .x-dock-vertical > .x-dock-body'
                for any padding or margins you may have added. We have change the TouchTweets example from using a
                component based DataView to the new List very easily and should be a good example of using the
                new List component with dynamic large lists.
            </strong></p>
            <p><strong>
                We are releasing an update to Sencha Command and the Native Packager. This includes many bugfixes and
                enhancements including:

                We continue to add more to charting, and this release includes some of the labeling, grouped bar charts,
                axis titles, and more.  We want the next release for charting to be feature complete so expect the last chart types
                and missing functionality to be added soon.

            <p><strong>

                This is the initial beta for Touch 2.1 which is focused on the new charting
                package as well as bug fixes. The charting package has had a major rewrite and includes SVG support
                on devices which can support it.  Most devices perform faster with Canvas and will use that engine
                by default.  We will be adding more charting types and other missing functionality in charts
                throughout the beta cycle. The next release will be more focused on performance enhancements
                with updates to the layouts and events.

            <p><b>Special Notes:</b></p>
            <p><b>If you are using a LocalStorage proxy, from now on your Model's <i>identifier</i> strategy must generate unique id's.
                We suggest you use the included UUID strategy by adding <i>identifier: 'uuid'</i> to your Model definition. Any existing
                Models you have saved to LocalStorage will need to have this added. A warning will be thrown for any Model configured
                with a LocalStorage proxy that doesn't have a unique id generating strategy.</b></p>
            <p>The <strong>change</strong> event in <i>Ext.field.Select</i> has been changed to return the new and old
                values and not records. This is to make it more consistent with all other form fields.</p>

            <p>Application dependency logic has been tweaked to allow more versatility in specifying dependencies from
                packages outside your application. As of this release any combination of local and external dependencies
                should be possible, but you'll need use Ext.Loader.setPath to specify where external dependencies can be
                found. See the <a href="http://docs.sencha.com/touch/2-0/#!/api/Ext.app.Application">updated Application
                    class docs</a> for sample usage.</p>

        <div style="margin: 10px">
            <p><b>Notes:</b></p>

            <p>Navigation View has been updated so the 'stack' is now based on the <b>items</b> config/collection. This
                means that if you define more than 1 item in a navigation view, the last item will <i>always</i> be the
                active item. The animation methods have also been removed from Navigaiton View. Instead, you should change
                the animation using the view.getLayout().setAnimation() setter instead, just like you would on a
                Ext.Container.</p>

            <p>The signature returned in the <b>callback</b> configuration of <b>Ext.util.JSONP#request</b> has changed.
                Previously it only returned the JSON object. It now returns the success value (Boolean) as the first
                argument and then the JSON object as the second argument. The class has also been deprecated</p>

            <p>The sencha-touch-debug.js shipped with Beta 2 now includes deprecated compatibility methods. Please remember
                that in order to use the smaller build without compatibility, you will need to fix any deprecation warnings
                you receive during development</p>
        </div>

        Release Notes: Release Notes: January 23, 2012<br>
        Version Number: 2.0.0.pr4
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Enhancements/Changes
            <ul>
                <li>Added 7 new guides, including a <a href="docs/#!/guide/upgrade_1_to_2">1.x -> 2.x Migration Guide</a>
                </li>
                <li>Data refactored:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The data packed now makes full use of the config system and we recommend that configs be
                            used with the data package as with the rest of your applications.
                        </li>
                        <li>The performance of the data package has been signifigantly improved.</li>
                        <li>There are some event changes in the Data package and backwards compatibility for the old add,
                            update,
                            and remove events is not fully in place. The old events have severe performance implications and
                            we strongly recommend all developers change to the new addrecords, updaterecord, and
                            removerecords.
                            In addition we have added a new 'refresh event' to supplant the old 'datachanged event' which
                            was
                            fired under too many circumstances.
                        </li>
                        <li>Many issues with LocalStore/WebStore are resolved and this should now work properly.
                            Please note that assosciated local stores are not in place yet.
                        </li>
                        <li>Store paging is back in place and operational.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>MVC refactored:

                        <li>All classes now use the 2.x class and config system</li>

                            <a href="docs/#!/guide/controllers">Controllers</a> and <a href="docs/#!/guide/profiles">Device

                        <li>ComponentView is now fully integrated into DataView and it turned on by using the useComponents:
                            true flag as a configuration option
                        </li>
                        <li>The event signatures for DataView have been changed to handle both Element based items and
                            Component based items. In addition the record is now passed on all the item events.
                        </li>

                </li>

                        from the dom as it was not maintained when changes to the store changed the index. Instead the

                    <li>[TOUCH-1046] Fixed various issues with Map.mapOptions. Deprecated the update method as it conflicts
                        with the base Component update. This is now setMapCenter as that is what 'update' actually does.
                        Remove the now unused onUpdate method
                    </li>
