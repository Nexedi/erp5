erp5_upgrader business template upgrades ERP5 to the latest version from whatever the version which is currently installed.

It uses introspection to decide what should be upgraded (or not) and how. It is based on an alarm design which makes sure that everything on a given ERP5 site satisfies certain criteria: version of system libraries, version of products, version of business templates, existence of certain tools, configuration of certain tools, etc.

If all alarms are in OK state, it is considered as a proof that the upgrade process went well from an instance maintenance point of view (but it does not prove that the upgrade process produces working instances).
