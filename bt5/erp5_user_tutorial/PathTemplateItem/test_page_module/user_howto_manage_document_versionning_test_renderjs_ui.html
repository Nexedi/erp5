<h1>Upload the file</h1>
<img alt="Upload the file" src="osoe-howto-upload.file-screenshot.svg?format=png" title="Upload the file" type="image/png" />
<details open="open">
<p>Once you saved all informations required to classify the document, you can upload the original document into ERP5.</p>

<p>For that you just have to click on &#39;Choose File&#39; then to select the document on your computer. It will then write the path to the document into the field. When you click on the Save button, the document is then uploaded and converted.</p>

<p>You must take a look at the &#39;File State&#39; of the document. It will tell you if there is a document or not (ie. empty), and if the document is ready for use (ie. Converting or Converted).</p>

<p>We can see that the &#39;Revision&#39; which is under the &#39;File State&#39; is increasing each time we click on the &#39;Save&#39; button. This is because the system keep track of every changes which are made on the document.</p>

<h1>Work on the document</h1>
<img alt="Work on the document" src="osoe-howto-work.document-screenshot.svg?format=png" title="Work on the document" type="image/png" />
<details open="open">
<p>When you want to work on the document, you first have to download an editable file, then do the changes you want and upload it again.</p>

<p>In order to download the file, you must click on the <strong>Export</strong> Icon,&nbsp;You can then choose the format of the file and the name of the file which will be created. By default the name is &#39;Reference-Version-Language&#39;. It is a good name since it create a unique file name for this document.</p>

<p>Once you download the file, you can edit it with the proper software. We recommend you to use LibreOffice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once it is finished, you can re-upload the file as you did before. Click on &#39;Browse&#39; on the main tab of the document, select the document on your computer, then click on the &#39;Save&#39; button.</p>

<p>You can see that the revision number has increased. Each change is recorded and kept in the system so you don&#39;t loose any informations.</p>

<p>Note: Be careful while you have the document on your computer, anyone can download, edit and upload the new version of the document. If you upload your file after, you will erase his/her changes. You must perform your changes as quickly as you can, and make sure that no one else is working on it in the same time.</p>

<h1>Release the document</h1>
<img alt="Release the document" src="osoe-howto-release.document-screenshot.svg?format=png" title="Release the document" type="image/png" />
<details open="open">
<p>Once you created a document which is good enough, you can create a release. A release means that you mark the document as the official version of this document. For that you can use the menu&nbsp;&quot;<b>Release Document&quot; </b>on the sidebar.</p>

<p>Releasing a document is an important step. It makes the document official. It is not any more a working copy of the document, but it is a document which can be used.</p>

<h1>Prepare next version</h1>

<p><img alt="Clone document" src="osoe-howto-clone.document.svg?format=png" title="Prepare next version" type="image/png" /></p>

<p><img alt="Clone document 2" src="osoe-howto-clone.document.2.svg?format=png" title="Prepare next version" type="image/png" /></p>

<details open="open">
<p>After publishing the first version of your document, you might want to work on the next release. You could create a new document from scratch, but the easiest way is to duplicate the document which already exist, then to increase the version of the document as showing on the screenshots.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We now have a new working copy of the document to prepare next version. You can work on it as we explained before.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Release/Publish the second version</h1>

<details open="open">
<p>As long as the new working copy stays in draft, the state of the previous version won&#39;t be changed. If you&nbsp;share or publish the new working copy,&nbsp;the older version will be automatically archived.</p>

<p>You are now able to manage and keep track of all your documents.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: Don&#39;t forget to create &#39;Naming Convention&#39; for the reference of your documents. It will unify the references used for your documents, and when the &#39;Naming Conventions&#39; are well known by every one, it is easier to search a document thanks to its URL just because you can guess how the reference should look like.</p>
