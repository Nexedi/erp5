          <p>From last tutorial we have learned the standard process of managing incoming Events. In this tutorial, we will specially introduce the process of how to manage the Ticket "Support Request", following the standard process of managing incoming Events explained in last tutorial.</p><p>Support Request is a kind of Ticket which the incoming Events (email, phonecall, fax, etc.) of your customers are assigned to, and which is a very important Ticket in ERP5 CRM because it allows you to manage all the interactions between your customer, your company and your supplier effectively, which helps consolidating the customer relations of your company.</p>

          <p>This tutorial is based on a scenario that will help you understand how to manage Support Requests and the role of this kind of Ticket.</p><p>Z Company is an electricity supplier, one of VIFIB clients who are using the ERP5 instance. John Scott Doh is the marketing manager of Z Company. From this year, as the other departments of Z Company, he starts to implement the ERP5 to manage his marketing department, and specially the ERP5 CRM for his business with his clients. In the very beginning of using this new instance, he met some difficulties in the configuration of the ERP5 instance, so he wrote to the ERP5 support team asking for help. When the ERP5 support team receives the email from this client, someone in the team will create a new incoming Event in ERP5  in order to ask for someone who is capable to answer to the request of John Doh.</p><p>Now please follow this scenario, combine with the standard incoming Events process you have learned, to see what's the steps to take in ERP5 to manage the support requests from your clients.</p>

            In ERP5 CRM, in order to better manage the customer relations, once we receive an incoming email, phonecall or fax from our clients, we will have to <strong>create a new incoming Event from the support request sender's document</strong>
            in order to tell our team that we receive a message from our client. In this way, all the support requests from our clients will be recorded immediately, and be assigned to personnel to handle them later.
          </p><p>In our example, we will first create an incoming Event to inform our ERP5 support team that we have received an email from John Doh who is asking for help. As it is John Doh who sent this email, we will create the incoming Event directly from John Doh's Person Document, in order for the Event to be linked easily to John Doh in ERP5.</p><p>
            In order to <strong>create an incoming Event from the request sender John Doh's document</strong>
            , the

            will be to
            <strong>reach John Doh's person document</strong>
            in ERP5. To do so,
            <strong>click on the “Browse” tab</strong>

            As you have learned in the previous tutorial “How to Prepare Outgoing Events”, when the new Event is created, you can first set the basic information such as <strong>Event title, type and direction</strong>
            , etc. The only difference here is to
            <strong>set the Event Direction to “In”</strong>
            this time, because you want to create an Incoming Event, indicating that you have received an email in this case, and then you will enter this email in your ERP5 for someone of your team to process it.
          </p><p>Now you can copy and paste the email you have received from your client John Doh into "Message" area, or you can also do it later in the Event edit page.</p><p>
            In order to follow this tutorial, check <strong>Keep in draft state</strong>
            option in order to create an Event on "Draft" State. Afterwards, we are going to learn how to learn how to declare it as received manually.
          </p><p>
            When you are done, <strong>click the “Create New Event”</strong>

          <p>Now it is time to define who should process this Event - the person in the ERP5 support team who will have to provide John Doh with an answer.
We will ask our team member “Yingjie XU” to take care of this Event.
          </p><p>To be able to proceed with this step you must have already created the Person and user account for Yingjie XU by following the tutorial <a href="howto-Create.New.User">How to create new User</a>.
         </p><p>
            To assign the Event to “Yingjie XU”, first <strong>change the person name in the “Recipient” field</strong> from "Jingjing XU" (the default Recipient) to "Yingjie XU". Second, as usual, don't forget to <strong>"Save"</strong>.
          </p><p>This step aims at indicating that “Yingjie XU” should receive this email from the client, and has to take care of it. So after the step that we "Receive" the Event, this Event will appear on Yingjie's worklist as "Received Events to Deliver", which we will show you later. In this way, Yingjie will know that he is responsible to handling a new incoming Event.</p>

            According to the standard process of incoming Events, if the Event can be handled in a simple way, we can <strong>Create Response directly</strong>
            from the Received Event's Action item list, as the option shown in the blue frame. But if the incoming Event needs to be handled in a complicated way, which needs a Ticket to contain many following Events, as in our case the support request from our client, we will then need to
            <strong>Create Follow Up Ticket</strong>
            from the Received Event's Action item list, as the option shown in the red frame.
          </p><p>
            So the next step will be to assign this Event to a Ticket. If you remember correctly, a Ticket can be a campaign, a sale opportunity, a support request, a meeting, etc...In this case, the client has asked for help in his email, so this is clearly a Support Request that has to be created. In order to create this Support Request Ticket, <strong>open the Action Item List and choose the action “Create Follow Up Ticket”</strong>

            . In our example, we will choose "Support Request" as Ticket type, which means that later we will be able to find this support request Ticket in the Support Request module of ERP5. After created, this Ticket can receive many different Events afterwards, such as the reply from ERP5 support team member, and the further questions from the client John Doh. When you are done,

          <p>Now it is time to reply to the client. If you remember, we have created a Follow Up Ticket for this Event in order to record all the following interactions related to the original Event. But the same as those Events which can be handled in a simple way so not need to be assigned to a Follow Up Ticket, we will use the Action item List in the Event page to create responses to our clients. The only difference is, all the Events of replies or other interactions created from this Event will be related to it by "Event Origin" and be recorded in the Follow Up Ticket we created.</p><p>
            Now we will <strong>click on "Create Response" in the Action item List</strong>

            We can see first that not much information has been edited, but you can do it now. Indeed, we have just created this ticket but not edited it yet. You can find some help in the tutorial <strong>“How to Create a Marketing Campaign”</strong>

          </p><p>
            <strong>The red area displays all the related Events stored in this ticket</strong>
            . As you can see there are three Events listed: the first one is the original Event which is the incoming Event we created to notice our team of John's question. This Event is on the Delivered state, because user “Yingjie” acknowledged it. The second and third ones are the answers that we created for John Doh. These Events are on the “Sent” state, because the email was sent to the client!
          </p><p>
            <strong>From now on, this Support Request can be used if in the future, client John Doh sends new emails about configuration problems</strong>
            . The only thing you will have to do in order to add Events to this Support Requests, is to open the “Action” item list and select “Create new Event”. Then the new Event will be created and associated automatically to the Ticket, as described in the
            <strong>“How to Prepare Outgoing Events”</strong>
            tutorial.
