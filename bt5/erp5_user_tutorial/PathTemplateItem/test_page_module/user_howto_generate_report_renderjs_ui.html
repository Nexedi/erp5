<details open="open">
<p>In order to see the list of reports available to generate, click on the <strong>Site Reports</strong> tab on your ERP5 instance sidebar.</p>

<p>Once clicking on the <strong>Site Reports</strong>, you can see the Accounting area displaying a list of the reports you are able to generate: Trial Balance, Account Statement, Journal, Third Parties, General Ledger, Aged Balance, Balance Sheet, Profit and Loss, and Invoices Report. In order to create a report, <strong>simply click on the title of the report you want to create</strong> . In our example, we will create Account Statement.</p>

<h1>Example: Account Statement</h1>

<p><img alt="The Account.Statement Button" src="user-Howto.Generate.Report.Create.Edit.Account.Statement.1.Svg?format=png" title="The Reports tab" type="image/png" />&nbsp;1</p>
<img alt="Account Statement" src="user-Howto.Generate.Report.Create.Edit.Account.Statement.2.Svg?format=png" title="Account Statement" type="image/png" />
<details open="open">
<p>Here is an example of an Account Statement report Creation. As you can see in the screenshot, please follow the steps to set the following information.</p>

<p>Firstly,&nbsp;the <strong>Section Category</strong> is the group your company belongs to, you will have only one choice here (if you only have one group in your ERP5 instance); <strong>From Date</strong> and <strong>At Date (end date)</strong> are the dates delimiting your report. <strong>The At Date is compulsory</strong> .</p>

<p>Secondly, you can choose which <strong>Simulation State(s)</strong> you want to display in your report, and the <strong>Journal Type (types of transactions)</strong> you need to display.</p>

<p>Thirdly, you have to <strong>choose an Account, this is compulsory</strong> , and then you can choose one of your <strong>Bank Account</strong> if you have several ones.</p>

<p>Then, you can choose to display the <strong>Detailed Beginning Balance</strong> , and to <strong>Omit Grouped References</strong> . You can also choose the <strong>Format</strong> of your report. As you will see in this item list, many formats are already supported by ERP5.</p>

<p>Finally, when you are done editing, click the <strong>&quot;Account Statement&quot;</strong> button. Then you can <strong>save or print</strong> this Account Statement.</p>
