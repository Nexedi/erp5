            In order to do an accounting transaction you have to <strong>initiate it</strong>
            .
          </p><p>
            An accounting transaction is a three step procedure :<br>
            First, you need to start the transaction, which means that the accounting lines will be created. In accounting terms, this is called
            <strong>Journalise Transaction</strong>
            . The second step is to validate the transaction, once you have checked the different accounting lines that have been generated automatically by ERP5. In accounting terms, this is called
            <strong>Post Transaction To General Ledger</strong>
            . Once those two steps are over, you can
            <strong>Definitively Close Accounting Transaction</strong>
            .
          </p><p>Be careful: once the transaction is closed, you will not be able to modify it. This is why some companies do not close their transactions until the end of their accounting period.</p><p>
            As you can see in the screenshot of the "Accounting View" tab of the invoice, the state is "Confirmed", and there is not any "Accounting Transaction Lines" yet. To start the transaction, browse the “Action” menu on top of the page and click on the line <strong>"Journalise Transaction"</strong>
            , then you will see on the next page, this will
            <strong>create the first accounting lines</strong>
            .

          <p>Before trying to go further in the accounting process, we will analyse what changes occurred on the invoice document after we journalised transaction.</p><p>First, as you can see in red on the screenshot, the state has changed from "Confirmed" to "Journalised". This means that ERP5 has created some accounting lines for your transaction.</p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>It can take up to 5 minutes until the accounting lines have been created. You might have to refresh the page, if you don't see the accounting lines.</p>

<p>This is the second part of the analysis: as you can see in blue, the first accounting transaction lines have been created. They are automatically created by ERP5, and, if you can read the accounting lines, they represent your transaction. In our example, the sell account should be credited with 100000€. If you did not yet subscribe to ERP5, you may not know that more than one accounting plan is available. On this screenshot, the French accounting plan is used, but many others are available. We already have accounting plans catered especially for Africa and Japan, and we are constantly working on developing more plans that will be available soon.</p><p>Note that a transaction can be modified as long as it is at "Journalised" state.</p><p>
            <strong>However, even though the accounting transaction lines have been created, but they have not been validated yet</strong>.
            To validate the transaction, you have to acting "Post to General Ledger". Please see next page.

            After "Post to General Ledger", as shown in the screenshot, the invoice state changed from "Journalised" to <strong>"Posted to General Ledger"</strong>
            . In fact, this state is similar to "Journalised", unless it has to be seen as a transition state between “Journalise” and “ Definitely Closed” state to indicate that the transaction has been validated.
          </p><p>
            When validated by acting "Post Transaction to General Ledger", a transaction can still be modified. If you browse the action menu, you will find a line that is called <strong>"Restart Transaction (journalise)"</strong>
            , which helps you invalidate the transaction and go back to the “Journalised” state.
          </p><p>
            Now the <strong>“Post Transaction to General Ledger” action insures that the transaction has been accepted, and the management has been transferred from sales department to accounting department</strong>
            .

            To <strong>close a transaction</strong>
            , browse the “Action” menu and choose “
            <strong>Definitively Close Transaction</strong>
            ”. Once this is done, the state of the transaction will be changed from "Posted to General Ledger" to
            <strong>Closed</strong>
            , and you will be able to
            <strong>create a payment</strong>
            for it, as we will see on the next tutorial “How to create a Payment”.

            ERP5 allows you to <strong>print</strong>
            the invoices you have created.
          </p><p>
            We will now explain how you can easily <strong>print</strong>
            an invoice you just created. You can print an invoice at any state, even if the transaction is not closed yet.
          </p><p>
            The first step to print an invoice, is to click on the
            <strong>Printer</strong>
            button on top of the invoice sheet, as you can see on the screenshot.
          </p><p>
            Clicking this icon will open a new window in which you will be able to change the settings of the <strong>Print</strong>
            .

            The <strong>print setting page</strong>
            is now open, so you can browse the different menus to choose which kind of print you need.
          </p><p>
            Firstly, <strong>choose the language</strong>
            of your print, in our example, the language can be either set to French or English. Secondly,
            <strong>choose the format</strong>
            of your print.
          </p><p>
            When you are done, <strong>click the option "Print Invoice"</strong>
            to create a physical copy of the document. You can either
            <strong>print directly with your printer</strong>
            , or
            <strong>save a copy of the invoice into PDF or other formats</strong>
            to keep it on your computer, so you can print it or send it by email later.
