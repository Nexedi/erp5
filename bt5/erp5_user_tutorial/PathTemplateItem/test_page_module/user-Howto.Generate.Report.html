            In order to see the list of reports available to generate, click on the Reports tab of your ERP5 instance. On the left, you can see the Accounting area displaying a list of the reports you are able to generate: Import Report, Trial Balance, Account Statement, Journal, Third Parties, General Ledger, Balance Sheet, Profit and Loss, and Invoices Report. In order to create a report, <strong>simply click on the line of the report you want to create</strong>
            . In our example, we will create Account Statement.

        <h1>Example: Account Statement</h1>

          <p>Here is an example of an Account Statement report Creation. As you can see in the screenshot, please follow the steps to set the following information.</p><p>
            Firstly, in the red area, the <strong>Section Category</strong>
            is the group your company belongs to, you will have only one choice here;
            <strong>From Date</strong>
            and
            <strong>At Date (end date)</strong>
            are the dates delimiting your report.
            <strong>The At Date is compulsory</strong>
            .
          </p><p>
            Secondly, in the blue area, you can choose which <strong>Simulation State(s)</strong>
            you want to display in your report, and the
            <strong>Journal Type (types of transactions)</strong>
            you need to display.
          </p><p>
            Thirdly, in the yellow area, you have to <strong>choose an Account, this is compulsory</strong>
            , and then you can choose one of your
            <strong>Bank Account</strong>
            if you have several ones.
          </p><p>
            Then, in the green area, you can choose to display the <strong>Detailed Beginning Balance</strong>
            , and to
            <strong>Omit Grouped References</strong>
            . You can also choose the
            <strong>Format</strong>
            of your report. As you will see in this item list, many formats are already supported by ERP5.
          </p><p>
            Finally, when you are done editing, click the <strong>"Account Statement"</strong>
            button. Then you can
            <strong>save or print</strong>
            this Account Statement.
