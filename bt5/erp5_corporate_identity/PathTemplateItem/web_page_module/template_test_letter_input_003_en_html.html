<p><b><i>Recommendation Letter for someone</i></b></p>

<p>
Dear Mr Couscous, <br/>
Dear Mr Burgur,
</p>
<p>
Someone has done a six month traineeship with us in the summer of 2015 and 
asked me to write a reference letter for him. I'm responsible for recruiting
at company, have done the intial interviews with someone and was involved in
recommending for a temporary contract with another company.
</p>
<p>
On the technical side someone was working mostly on our foo solution and its
integration into bar. He was mentored by my colleague someone else. According
to him someone was able to hit the ground running although the complexity of the
topic was considerably. Someone succeeded in improving the integration of
foo in bar (<a href="lab.foobar.com">link to commits</a>) which today allows us 
to provide bar as default database in all our foo instances.
</p>
<p>
Personally I remember someone as an always friendly and helpful colleague who
was involved in daily trainee activities beyond his work as a developer - be it
in organising our "Trainee Days" (camping trip) or initiiating the "Trainee 101"
repository with helpful tips for future colleagues arriving in Lille and company
(advice for finding housing, getting a phone contract, etc.), which we are still 
using today.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to call me back in case you have further questions (01-23-456789-0).
