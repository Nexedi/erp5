<p><b><i>Recommendation Letter for someone</i></b></p>

<p>
Dear Mr Couscous, <br/>
Dear Mr Burgur,
</p>
<p>
Someone has done a six month traineeship with us in the summer of 2015 and 
asked me to write a reference letter for him. I'm responsible for recruiting
at Nexedi, have done the intial interviews with someone and was involved in
recommending for a temporary contract with scikit-learn.
</p>
<p>
On the technical side someone was working mostly on our NEO solution and its
integration into SlapOS. He was mentored by my colleague someone else. According
to him someone was able to hit the ground running although the complexity of the
topic was considerably high. Someone succeeded in improving the integration of
NEO in SlapOS (<a href="lab.nexedi.com">link to commits</a>) which today allows us to provide NEO as default
database in all our SlapOS instances.
</p>
<p>
<p>
Personally I remember someone as an always friendly and helpful colleague who
was involved in daily trainee activities beyond his work as a developer - be it
in organising our "Trainee Days" (camping trip) or initiiating the "Trainee 101"
repository with helpful tips for future trainees arriving in Lille and Nexedi (advice
for finding housing, getting a phone contract, etc.), which we are still using today.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to call me back in case you have further questions (01-23-456789-0).
