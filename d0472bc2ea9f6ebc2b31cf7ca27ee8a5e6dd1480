This commit was reviewed on
  https://lab.nexedi.com/nexedi/erp5/merge_requests/604

with strong objections from Julien Muchembled:

- whether messages with different dependencies (in particular serialization_tag)
  are kept rather than deleted is not better, i.e. the problem is elsewhere
  and this commit is only about performance
- about performance, the change itself is negligible and not better in all cases

With further optimization to process serialization_tag like other dependencies,
if possible, this commit may be more meaningful.
