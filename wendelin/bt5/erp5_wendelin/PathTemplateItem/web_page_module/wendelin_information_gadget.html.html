    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    
    <p>The Wendelin project started in the beginning of 2015 with Nexedi as 
    consortium leader in charge of managing the development of a big data 
    solution "made in France". Wendelin is based on open source software 
    components and combines a number of widely used libraries for data 
    analysis, modification and visualization.</p>

    <h3>What is included?</h3>
    
    <p>Included in this instance is:</p>
