Wendelin is a Big Data platform based on ERP5 utilizing the NEO database.
=======

Wendelin = scikit-learn + "out-of-core" + NEO DB
-----------

Wendelin combines the performance of scikit-learn machine learning library with 
NEO DB distributed storage in order to provide out-of-core processing of large 
data sets.

Main applications
-----------

Wendelin's current main applications are industrial big data and video processing. 
Any industrial problem of prediction can be handled with Wendelin: mechanical 
health prediction, intrusion prediction, power prediction, etc. 

In addition, thanks to other Numpy based libraries such as OpenCV or Pandas, 
Wedelin can be applied to other fields such as video processing or finance.
